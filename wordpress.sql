Isso expande ainda mais o novo sistema de estilos e permite que atalhos mudem a aparência do seu site, tudo dentro de um único tema. Você pode alterar tanto as configurações disponíveis, como o peso da fonte e as opções de estilo, como a paleta de cores padrão.

Escolha desativar a opção de mover um bloco, remover um bloco ou ambos. Isso simplifica a entrega do projeto, permitindo que seus clientes liberem sua criatividade sem se preocupar em quebrar acidentalmente o site no processo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Melhorias de acessibilidade da versão WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acessibilidade é parte integrante da missão do WordPress de promover uma comunidade inclusiva e apoiar usuários de todos os tipos em todo o mundo.

Não há necessidade de mudar os temas!<br><strong>Mais opções de modelo</strong>s: Use blocos para editar mais cinco modelos (autor, data, categorias, tag e taxonomia).<br><strong>Seleção múltipla</strong>: Selecione facilmente o texto em vários blocos. Edite ao seu gosto.<br><strong>Reter estilos</strong>: Mantenha seus estilos personalizados no lugar, seja transformando entre blocos ou criando novos botões.<br><strong>Mais padrões em mais lugares</strong>: o Quick Inserter apresenta padrões que podem funcionar bem para a condição em que você está, criando padrões relevantes para partes de modelo e páginas em que você está trabalhando.<br><strong>Melhorias na visualização de lista</strong>: Novos atalhos de teclado (shift + clique) permitem selecionar vários blocos para modificar em massa (reposicionar, excluir, etc.), ver seu conteúdo rapidamente com uma visualização recolhida por padrão e muito mais.<br><strong>Ferramentas de design refinadas</strong>: Explore um novo painel de cores, opções de transparência, mais variações de blocos de grupo para criar novas opções de layout (pilha, linha), a capacidade de definir sua imagem em destaque em um bloco de capa, controle do tamanho exato da imagem em destaque, suporte para o bloco de galeria e muito mais.<br><strong>Novos blocos</strong>: Comentários, leia mais, sem resultados no loop de consulta, biografia do autor e blocos de avatar.<br><strong>Limitar alterações de bloco</strong>: Opte por desativar a opção de remover um bloco, movê-lo ou ambos.<br><strong>Exportar temas de bloco</strong>: Explore a ferramenta de exportação de tema de bloco aprimorada, à medida que o WordPress se aproxima da construção de tema de bloco visual sem código.<br><strong>API Webfonts</strong>: Gerencie fontes locais com PHP ou theme.json.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Agradecemos os seguintes colaboradores por colaborarem neste artigo: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">@annezazu</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\">@marybaum</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/priethor/\">@priethor</a> e <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:35:\"https://br.wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:01:10 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 01 Sep 2022 13:15:13 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:61:\"<https://br.wordpress.org/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}', 'no');

What is it exactly that you&#8217;ve decided?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. So for one it&#8217;s the networking part. We&#8217;re surely gonna talk about later, we, um, working on a couple of WordPress products and TasteWP, and I wanna spread the word for it. I also just wanna immerse myself in the WordPress spirit and energy. And what&#8217;s a better way than going to a WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. If you&#8217;ve not been to an event like this before, have you been in the WordPress space for any length of time or is this fresh to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Nick Ahmann: It&#8217;s not entirely fresh. So we&#8217;ve been developing plugins for about six, seven years now. Not me personally, I don&#8217;t have a clue about coding. I&#8217;ve been in the space that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] Nathan Wrigley: What is it that you&#8217;re expecting to do? I know you said that there was networking, but do you anticipate going into some of the talks? Is there any of that that interests you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, for sure. I&#8217;m gonna listen to some of the talks. I&#8217;ve noted down one or two. But it&#8217;s just, you know, meeting like random people in the hallway and just getting to know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] Nathan Wrigley: The hallway track is totally a thing. It&#8217;s a thing which I think probably a significant proportion of the people who come to these events actually never go into the presentations because they just enjoy the networking aspect and all of that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna talk today about a service that you offer. It integrates very well with WordPress. It is WordPress. It enables you to get WordPress in a heartbeat. It&#8217;s called TasteWP. What is it? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] Nick Ahmann: Okay. The point is, basically TasteWP, developed from scratch your own itch situation for us. Working on a couple of plugins and we needed an easy way to test them, different PHP versions and, and WordPress version combinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we never found a tool that really suits us. So we thought, okay, why not create such a tool? And then we thought, okay, uh, instead of just using it internally, why don&#8217;t we just make it a bit nicer and bit more self explanatory, as you would with a tool you only use internally, so that, uh, we can offer it to the public. So TasteWP is a site where you just go, click once and then it spins up a WordPress site where you can play around and test themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] Nathan Wrigley: So I confess that I&#8217;ve had a go and it&#8217;s very quick. I don&#8217;t know if that was part of the initial scoping document, to make it almost instantaneous, but when you go to the webpage and you click the button, there&#8217;s more to it than that, we&#8217;ll get to that, but if you just click the button, I&#8217;m pretty convinced you&#8217;re under five seconds before the site is live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] Nick Ahmann: Right. Just over three seconds is now the average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: Which is pretty incredible given what&#8217;s going on. You know, you&#8217;re spinning up some sort of server in the background and downloading plug-ins and themes. And again, we&#8217;ll get to that and it&#8217;s configurable, but it&#8217;s basically there in the time it takes you to pick up your coffee cup, have a sip, and then return it to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] Nick Ahmann: And let me just mention, I wish I could take credit for it, but it&#8217;s entirely the developers who did this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] Nathan Wrigley: The, principle though, when we got into talking about coming on the podcast, you talked about it from the community angle. You mentioned that it would be a really nice tool for community to get their hands on. Talk to us about that. Tell us how do you sort of pitch it as a community tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] Nick Ahmann: Right. I think it&#8217;s our contribution to the community in the sense that I think everybody who works with WordPress, uh, no matter what the role of function is that they need such a tool. You can talk about the developers who need a site to test their themes and plugins like that was the initial idea, why we needed it. But then beginners who just start out with WordPress, they need an easy way to spin up a site and play around. Also again for developers to demo their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you can do is, if you, for example, if you&#8217;re in the, um, plug-in directory on WordPress and you on a plugin page, like, wordpress.org/plugins/pluginslug. And in that URL, if you just replace WordPress with TasteWP and click enter, then it spins up a site with that plugin already installed. And that&#8217;s useful, I think for almost everybody, especially also for those who want to try out plugins before using them on the real site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] Nathan Wrigley: So the principle is, it felt like the best fit for me, at least anyway, was I want to try out this plugin, X plugin over there that I&#8217;ve never used before, and I could create a domain and do all of that and do hosting, or I could set up a local install or something like that, which will work fine, but I want something probably a bit more disposable. I know that I&#8217;m just gonna try it for a few hours perhaps, and then I want that site to go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what it does because, in the initial offering that you&#8217;ve got, maybe there&#8217;s kinda like a premium upsell that you offer as well, but you are able to use that site for, I believe it&#8217;s 48 hours. Is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s right. So if you&#8217;re not logged in TasteWP, it&#8217;s good for two days and then expires. And, uh, if you sign up on TasteWP, which is free, then it lasts for seven days and then you can also manage your sites. So you can set up several ones. You can delete an old site set up a new site and so on. And at the moment it&#8217;s all free. And we&#8217;re working on a premium option when basically it won&#8217;t expire then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So in the future there&#8217;ll be an option to pay and you&#8217;ll be able to keep your site up. Okay. So at the point where you create the site, there&#8217;s multiple options. You could just click the button and you go. And like I said, 2, 3, 4 seconds later, it&#8217;s ready to go, but there&#8217;s a little bit more to it than that. Tell us about the options that are available. What can you configure?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:43] Nick Ahmann: So there&#8217;s the quick setup option, by the way, you can always trigger it again without being logged in, which makes it very usable. But, if you click on the advanced setup option, then you can determine, okay, which WordPress version do you wanna use the plugin or whatever you&#8217;re testing on. Especially now that WordPress six came out. That was a function, which was used quite a lot because plugin developers want to see, how does the plugin work on WordPress six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same with PHP version. You can set that. You can already select to pre-install certain plugins, themes, that&#8217;s possible too. If you sign up, then you can also create templates, where you can say, okay, this URL should spin up an instance with these plugins and these themes already installed, because sometimes you have plugins which rely on other plugins to be installed as well. So it&#8217;s not just a single plugin, which is installed in, but also others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:36] Nathan Wrigley: So essentially the idea here is speed. You&#8217;ve got the option to just, you get to the site, you don&#8217;t need to be logged in if you&#8217;re willing to go for a two day site. You press a button, a couple of seconds later you&#8217;re ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things which come along for the ride. In WordPress, we&#8217;re a bit averse to advertising in the admin UI. I know that you have a fairly large, dismissable, ad right at the beginning. It&#8217;s not really an ad. It&#8217;s more sort of, here&#8217;s how it works, because you&#8217;ve already got them to your website. So, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] Nick Ahmann: Actually that&#8217;s a good point. We made that part much leaner. So actually there was this like almost full page introduction, uh, which is now only, if you spin it up in certain ways, we&#8217;re gonna expand it to all the ways you can spin up. It&#8217;s just a box in the top right which says this is a demo site expiring in, um, so and so many hours. But if you talk about advertising to be absolutely honest here, part of the incentive for us to do this was also to promote our own plugins because they are pre-installed as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not entirely, you know, off topic. There&#8217;s a backup and migration plugin, which many TasteWP users need because whatever they created on TasteWP, they want to take it somewhere else. So they need this migration plug. So it&#8217;s not completely off topic, but that&#8217;s also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:48] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s go into that, because I think that is actually right on topic. So you justifiably, I think in my opinion, if you&#8217;ve offered this service for free, people don&#8217;t have to use it. They can do all the other things that I said earlier about spinning up sites, they can do it that way. Or they can opt for you. What are the things that do come pre-installed? Presumably it&#8217;s the suite of things that you and the company that you are working for offer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s three plugins now. It&#8217;s a redirect plug. The backup plugin I mentioned, and the plugin for, uh, showing popups on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: And they all come pre-installed? Yeah. And I&#8217;m guessing though, it&#8217;s WordPress, I&#8217;m guessing that you could deactivate those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] Nick Ahmann: Yes, absolutely. You can, actually, there&#8217;s a plugin, which if you run it, it resets. I think it&#8217;s called reset WordPress, I&#8217;m not sure what plugin is. And quite a few people use that because they don&#8217;t want to see our plugins. But most, you know, still see our plugins and that&#8217;s part of the reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:37] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s talk about the different ways that you can get certain things to be activated. Obviously, if you choose to go in, you can just go to the ad plugin page and add one plugin at a time. But there&#8217;s this nifty thing which you alluded to earlier, which, as soon as I figured out what was going on, because I didn&#8217;t, when I first came across your site. Soon as I figured that out, I thought, okay, that&#8217;s the bit, that&#8217;s where the coin dropped for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the utility came in. You can go to TasteWP.com farward slash, and then how do we do the URL from there? Basically, if you add to the URL, something that&#8217;s in the repository, be that a theme or a plugin. So long as you get the plugin slug exactly right, it will become installed. There&#8217;s maybe a little bit that I missed out in the URL there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:23] Nick Ahmann: Yes. So the easiest way is if you just go to the plugin in the, uh, WordPress directory, and then replace the WordPress in the URL with TasteWP. So that&#8217;s the quickest, actually that&#8217;s not the quickest way. We also offer a bookmarklet tool, which is a button you can drop to your bookmarklet bar in your browser. And then when you are on a plugin page in the directory, you just have to click it and then already it spins up instance with that plugin installed. And we are also working at the moment on a Chrome extension, which basically does the same thing, but maybe some little more features here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:57] Nathan Wrigley: So can you concatenate, so can you add, one plugin, two two plugins, three plugins and two themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] Nick Ahmann: There&#8217;s more sophisticated ways you can install several plugins and themes, uh, at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:08] Nathan Wrigley: And so the bookmark would then store the information about that because you have essentially kept the URL with all of the bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve added to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] Nick Ahmann: Right so what happens technically? This is one of the few instances where I understand what happens technically, because as mentioned, I&#8217;m not a developer. If you click on the bookmarklet tool, when on the plugin page in the directory, something called HTTP referral, which passes on the URL you&#8217;re currently on to TasteWP. So TasteWP knows from which side you&#8217;re coming from. So we know which plugin you have in mind to have pre-installed. And that&#8217;s what we, what we&#8217;re doing then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:41] Nathan Wrigley: Has this been a popular tool? I mean, I dunno how how long it&#8217;s been out. I certainly came across it for the first time ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:46] Nick Ahmann: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a good question, how long? I think about a year now. And yes, the usage is increasing strongly. Uh, we getting fantastic feedback from developers, but also non developers. Especially as it&#8217;s free and it can be used without logging that that&#8217;s what people like a lot. Of course, that&#8217;s also prone to risks because you know, people can do dodgy things on these free sites. They can use it for phishing attempts and all of that, because there are no checks, basically, if somebody spins up a site, if it&#8217;s not dodgy. So we have to stay one step ahead in terms of quickly identifying the sites, which could cause trouble. I don&#8217;t know what the percentage is. Most are nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:30] Nathan Wrigley: And what have they been using it for then? Have you got some useful metrics? No, sorry, what are the genuine people using it for? You know, they&#8217;ve got a two day site. Why are they coming to you and trying it it out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:41] Nick Ahmann: Okay. So for one it&#8217;s developers who want to try out the plugins. Other big segments are beginners, and also that the teachers. The teachers, WordPress teachers love TasteWP to, for example, give their students some exercises they have to do. So spin up a site in TasteWP and install this plugin and do this, create this theme or whatever it is. So teachers also a big segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:06] Nathan Wrigley: it&#8217;s really curious. I mean, if you delve deeper into it, do you have any sort of data about what people want you to do with it in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:14] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s a good question. I mean, WordPress can be used in so many different ways? I mean, what we focus on now at the moment is a tool for developers. And also there has another reason too. The developers can be our multipliers, because if we convince the developers to use our URL as a demo URL they use it for demoing their products. Then that means that way more users get to know about TasteWP and therefore we have more users. That&#8217;s the focus just to grow and get the word out about TasteWP. Then we can eventually at the end of the, the game we can monetize by offering the pay plans, which we don&#8217;t offer yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way everything you see at the moment, it will stay free forever. So we will need to justify the, the paid part with additional features we gonna add to the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s curious, and it really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m a plug-in developer and I&#8217;ve got a plugin over on the repo. Am I right in saying this? Is what you&#8217;re saying that I could simply copy and paste the TasteWP URL, put it over on my site and anybody that wants to try out my plugin instantly has access to that, obviously with the caveats that we&#8217;ve mentioned and the plugins that you bring to, to the site as well. But you would be able to use that plugin right off the bat, in couple of seconds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] Nick Ahmann: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. That makes more sense. Okay. I want to delve deeper into the sort of marketing angle here. Whose idea was it to offer the free service as the gateway if you like to the paid service? Because it feels to me there&#8217;s a lot of development work that went into this and it could have been an absolute flop, and it could have been never used by anybody, never discovered. And then it would&#8217;ve just been a complete waste of time, resources and of that. So who pushed this forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] Nick Ahmann: We always knew we needed the tool at least ourselves, which first of all means that even if nobody was interested in it, it was, you know, still worthwhile. The point is if you need it very strongly, there must be other people out there who needed it as well. So that gave us a bit of confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the free part is basically, our general philosophy in the freemium model. We offer some other tools and services as well. And for all of them the first challenge is to get users and to grow. And the freemium model is great. It&#8217;s great for us because we get the eyeballs, and it&#8217;s great for the users because they can use a lot of features for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it will probably, once we introduce the paid versions, it will still be the typical 98% of people not paying, just free riding, and it&#8217;s the 2% which monetize the whole thing then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:48] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have any data on, so at the minute, the paid version doesn&#8217;t exist, so that&#8217;s kind of off the table, but maybe in the future that&#8217;ll be a thing. So at the minute, the upsell is okay. here&#8217;s a free site. You can have it for a couple of days or seven days, depending on you logged in on it. But you mentioned all of the things that you throw in your backup plug in and so on and so forth. How has that conversion gone? Has it been successful? One site is better than no sites, but has it been effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] Nick Ahmann: We&#8217;d love to know that, but it&#8217;s so hard to track. We don&#8217;t know because I mean, they then see the plugin on our site, but well, we know it&#8217;s installed there. But the question is do they then find joy in it and also install it on their real actual sites? We have no way to track this. So this is just believing in building our brand and getting some recognition this way. But we don&#8217;t know how effective that actually is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:37] Nathan Wrigley: One of the things about the WordPress community is that they are, they&#8217;re ingenious. My experience is they often like to do things for themselves. You know, they like figure things out, solve puzzles, but there&#8217;s also a, a significant part who just like convenience and so on. So I&#8217;m guessing you are aiming it more those people who just like to have something quick and simple and easy. Is that your target market?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] Nick Ahmann: Yes. I mean, naturally because these are advantages that people who have these inclinations tend to use TasteWP. I mentioned the developers earlier. Some developers say, no, they want to have the local environment, which also has of course advantages. It doesn&#8217;t expire. There&#8217;s no space limitation and so on. It comes down also to personal taste very often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:18] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So let&#8217;s go into the paid model, which at the moment doesn&#8217;t exist. So caveat emptor. It might not in any way, shape or form look like what you&#8217;re about to describe, but let&#8217;s press on regardless. If we go for the premium, the upsell, whatever that thing is, you mentioned it will never go away. Are there other things which you are toying with as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:38] Nick Ahmann: Yes. The main one is the space one as well, because the free sites are limited to, I think, one gigabyte, which is not enough for some use cases. But most it is. I mean, one gigabyte is already quite some space. For some, it&#8217;s not enough. So that will be the main premium feature as well. What we don&#8217;t know yet, if we want to go down that route is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, naturally people want then to host with their own domain. That would mean we would just turn into a hoster and I&#8217;m not sure if we really want to do that. We&#8217;re playing with ideas to team up with a hosting, um, where we then pass on these users who need permanent hosting, not just for testing with their own domain and everything that comes with it, the backups also and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are not sure about that yet, but, for sure, even if it&#8217;s just for the testing there quite a few people out there who just want sites which don&#8217;t expire for testing alone. By the way, talking about not expiring, we offer an affiliate program. If you spin up a site, you will see that we offer you, if you invite your friends, and three of them sign up on TasteWP, you get a non expiring site. So that&#8217;s free hosting forever. Because you also mentioned marketing earlier, that&#8217;s another way we try to accelerate the marketing part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:50] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so if I&#8217;ve signed up for the, the paid plan, and I can use it forever. Do I just recycle that one site? In other words, do I get one site which I can just have forever, but I can just, as you said, reset at the beginning? How do I go through that process of expunging it, wiping it clean? Because presumably I&#8217;ve got a URL which is custom to me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:10] Nick Ahmann: Yes. At the moment what&#8217;s already possible, you can define the sub domain. So Nathan dot TasteWP, unless it&#8217;s taken already of course. And then once you are, you&#8217;re logged into TasteWP, there&#8217;s a dashboard where you can manage your sites and you can just delete one site, in order to spin up another site. Which then, once we have the paid plans you can use for that. So it&#8217;s not, you&#8217;re not stuck with a one site you created once, but you can just delete it. And then you have the right to set up a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] Nathan Wrigley: Any chance of siloing those. So putting a site away and saying, actually, I&#8217;ll come back to that next week, but this week I need to test this plugin out? So I don&#8217;t wanna remove that one, I just park it for a few days. Can you do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] Nick Ahmann: With the pay plans, yes. The paid plans depend on the number of sites you want. So it&#8217;s per site and there will be discount, discounts for if, you know, go for three sites at once. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gonna work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:06] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m gonna move away from TasteWP now, and just talk about, well, we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. Just gonna talk about what you&#8217;ve gained so far and what you think of it. You mentioned that you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp Europe before. I&#8217;ve been to a WordCamp Europe before. But this is quite significantly different to the ones that I&#8217;ve been to. In that this, this is really quite an impressive event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] Nick Ahmann: I don&#8217;t have any comparison. I didn&#8217;t know really what to expect. So when you say, uh, it&#8217;s different to the other ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] Nathan Wrigley: Bigger. Very professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] Nick Ahmann: I noticed that at the queue, when I wanted to get my food, that it&#8217;s huge. It was, it took quite a while. I knew that. How many at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:43] Nathan Wrigley: The last count I got was 2,700.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Nick Ahmann: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Nathan Wrigley: But I don&#8217;t know if that went up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] Nick Ahmann: Yeah. I mean, I knew it&#8217;s gonna be a lot, but it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] Nathan Wrigley: But for a free piece of software, it&#8217;s kind of extraordinary don&#8217;t you think? You know, something which you can download absolutely gratis, completely for free. If you just walk down the corridor, there&#8217;s bespoke signage for every single thing. Every window has got a WordCamp logo on it. Can you imagine the amount of effort by people who are not paid?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:14] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, that&#8217;s actually, now that you mentioned, I did think, um, when I saw just the, when new map and also just the emails you get ahead of the event, that, okay, this is done quite professionally. But it shows, you know, people may not get paid for it, but it shows the passion really drives quality, right, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] Nathan Wrigley: The passion is amazing, but this room that we&#8217;re in is pretty spartan, but the fact that somebody&#8217;s made an effort to make that and put that there. So behind Nick is a great big WordCamp Europe banner. So that in a minute, when the photographers come in, that&#8217;s behind you. There&#8217;s a lot of attention to detail, given that these people are doing it from remote destinations all over the world. And I think it&#8217;s incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] Nick Ahmann: You&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] Nathan Wrigley: Anything we missed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:58] Nick Ahmann: TasteWP is only part of other products. I mentioned the plugins, but there are a couple of others. So if you go to inisev.com, so in is ev is the first two letters of information is everything inisev.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] Nick Ahmann: You&#8217;re just gonna see our whole range of products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:13] Nathan Wrigley: Just outline them, just say what they are again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:15] Nick Ahmann: Okay. The main other products are follow it, which is a news platform, which also web admins can use to put a subscription form on their site so people can subscribe and then automatically get updated whenever a new post is published. My popups is a service where you can put the so much loved popups and banners. They don&#8217;t have to be annoying if you do it the right way, at the right time. Not right directly in your face, doesn&#8217;t have to be annoying. And also this, cookie notices are covered there as well. So, which are legal requirement, at least in the EU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and we have also a tracking app, which basically allows you to track anything you want in your life. Where manual data entry is not much of a hassle, so you can track things and then analyze correlations. So see if you work out that day, if that has an impact on your sleep and find things out about yourself. So nothing related to WordPress at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] Nathan Wrigley: And the one that is the one that probably I would be most drawn to is your back up and restore plugin? What&#8217;s that one called?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:14] Nick Ahmann: Backup migration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:15] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. For reasons that I can&#8217;t quite explain every single time I find a backup and restore plugin, I&#8217;m totally drawn to trying it out, but I haven&#8217;t tried yours out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:24] Nick Ahmann: You have to, if you appreciate speed, apparently which you do, then please try it out because it is very fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:29] Nathan Wrigley: Well, Nick, thank you for joining me on the podcast. Really appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: WooCommerce is Important for African Businesses and Beyond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72902\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-is-important-for-african-businesses-and-beyond/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:455:\"<p>The fact that WooCommerce open-sourced this to run on top of WordPress, this has helped a lot of businesses to push forward.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-is-important-for-african-businesses-and-beyond/\">devlife_snippet: WooCommerce is Important for African Businesses and Beyond</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 09:31:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Post Status: What’s in a Name?

It&#8217;s a far cry from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">500 block themes</a> WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy set as a goal for 2022, but the number is steadily climbing as theme authors find their footing and discover how quickly block themes can be created.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Gardner is throwing his hat into the ring again with his latest release. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/design-mode/\">Design Mode</a> is a new block theme created for freelancers and agencies to showcase their services and work. After its release, several of Gardener&#8217;s contemporaries, fellow theme designers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/1571867105728815106\">remarked</a> on how refreshing it is to see a block theme with &#8220;real world use cases,&#8221; as so many seem to be geared at bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode features <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit\">Outfit</a>, a geometric sans serif Google font, designed by Rodrigo Fuenzalida, a Venezuelan type designer based in Santiago de Chile. It is used for both headings and paragraph text throughout the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bg.design/design-mode/\">demo</a> gives the best idea of what the theme looks like with a curated set of images, titles, captions, menus, and buttons all filled with content. Once installed and activated on a new site, the theme looks very similar to the demo but has a placeholder image instead of the photos used in the demo. This is because the photos  did not have the right licensing for distribution on WordPress.org, but the way it ships has the advantage of giving users a visual blank slate for those featured sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode includes 10 different patterns, which are essentially all aspects of the design deconstructed into parts. There are multiple patterns for sections with cover, heading, text, and button, a query grid with three columns, a section with text and separators, a footer, and a header with site title and navigation perfectly spaced. The theme also conveniently includes a whole page pattern that will instantly reproduce the homepage in the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is an opinionated theme. Users can adjust colors for background, text, and links, and adjust various templates via full-site editing, but it does not come with additional style variations. Personal blogs may benefit from a kaleidoscope of style variations but a well-designed portfolio theme does not usually lend itself well to wide variations in style. In this case fewer options is a good thing that should preserve the simple palette the theme packages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very fast theme by itself. Gardner reports that Design Mode scores 99 and 100 on Google page speed for mobile/desktop. Depending on what plugins and optimizations a user has active, this theme could be a good choice for performance-conscious WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is Gardner&#8217;s third block theme in the directory. It bears some similarities to his black and white minimalist <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/avant-garde/\">Avant-Garde</a> theme but has more of a friendly showcase vibe that is suitable for personal portfolios, agencies, and any kind of service business that would benefit from an elegant, structured design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/design-mode/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> or inside WordPress via the admin themes browser.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 22:06:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: WebP by Default Pulled from Upcoming WordPress 6.1 Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-pulled-from-upcoming-wordpress-6-1-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3791:\"<p>Last month, the plan for WordPress to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-on-hold-for-6-1-after-new-objections-from-wordpress-lead-developers\">put on hold for the upcoming 6.1 release</a> after objections from lead developers. The original proposal had been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-merged-into-core-for-wordpress-6-1\">merged into core at the end of July</a>, despite significant critical feedback and concerns from WordPress&#8217; developer community. Yesterday, the feature was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:203\">reverted</a> in response to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/webp-in-core-for-6-1/\">post</a> about removing it from core in favor of development as a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-renews-push-for-canonical-plugins\">canonical plugin</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I’ve been reading through all the conversation and issues here. I am interested in supporting new formats and improving performance, but I think this change being pushed by default to users when they upgrade to 6.1 is a lot for right now, including with some of the clunky interactions OSes still have around webp (and HEIC!) files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m happy for support for working for webp and HEIC files to stay in&nbsp;core, as we should be liberal in what we accept and work with, but not with the change to convert everything to webp when JPEGs are uploaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During today&#8217;s Performance Team meeting, contributors briefly discussed the revert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are still trying to figure out what a canonical plugin is exactly, and if that would work for WebP by default,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein said. &#8220;We still have a couple of fixes to land for 6.1 around image quality when WebPs are output (which is still an option you just need a plugin for now).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the previous Performance team meeting Silverstein said Mullenweg&#8217;s post about the feature not shopping was a surprise to the team and that they were working with release leads to better understand concerns in hopes of finding a path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to acknowledge this is a blow for everyone who worked on the feature (myself included) and at the same time I&#8217;d like to encourage us to focus on how we can move forward given the current position,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Are there concerns we can address? Does a canonical plugin make sense?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in that discussion expressed concerns about getting users to adopt WebP by default if it is moved to its own plugin. It would require strategic rebranding to indicate that it delivers faster images, as most users won&#8217;t be familiar with the WebP format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think if it remains a &#8216;feature project,&#8217; it makes sense to remain in the Performance Lab plugin &#8211; we don&#8217;t know if moving it out of it would get us more testers (especially since the Performance Lab plugin has 10k+ installs which is a lot for a feature plugin),&#8221; Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If the path of a &#8216;canonical plugin&#8217; should be pursued, then of course we would need to take it out, but then the nature of the project would also change.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors will decide the next steps for the feature in future discussions. For now, users who were looking forward to WebP uploads by default can still get this feature using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> plugin, maintained by WordPress&#8217; Performance Team. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:29:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: A Candid Conversation on Hosting Benchmarks and Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72891\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-candid-conversation-on-hosting-benchmarks-and-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:443:\"<p>Kevin Ohashi from Review Signal and Ryan MacDonald from Liquid Web discuss the value of benchmarking and testing for hosting services. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-candid-conversation-on-hosting-benchmarks-and-testing/\">A Candid Conversation on Hosting Benchmarks and Testing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 10:03:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: New Block Diffusion Plugin Creates AI-Generated Images from Text Prompts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137969\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-diffusion-plugin-creates-ai-generated-images-from-text-prompts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3269:\"<p>AI image generation has quickly become more accessible over the past few months and is making its way into different industries that require asset creation. Although it&#8217;s still somewhat limited, AI image generators can create breathtaking photorealistic images from complex prompts. AI-assisted artists have even begun <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artists-begin-selling-ai-generated-artwork-on-stock-photography-websites/\">selling their works</a> on stock photography sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DALL-E 2 was the first to make a big splash on social media. Its closed platform and invite-only beta has kept many potential creators on the sidelines, but open source alternatives like Stable Diffusion are taking off. The machine learning, text-to-image model is improving thanks to its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/\">growing ecosystem</a> of contributors and extenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinbatdorf\">Kevin Batdorf</a>, an Application Developer at <a href=\"https://extendify.com/\">Extendify</a>, has created a free plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stable-diffusion/\">Block Diffusion</a> that uses Stable Diffusion to generate images inside the block editor based on text prompts. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Block Diffusion uses the public Replicate API to generate images in the cloud. This requires users have an account at replicate.com. It will generate some images for free but thereafter will be $0.01 USD per image using Replicate&#8217;s <a href=\"https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion\">Stable Diffusion model</a>. Images generate in six seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model was trained on <a href=\"https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/\">LAION-5B</a>, an open AI training dataset containing over five billion image-text pairs. It has some limitations in that it cannot achieve perfect photorealism or render legible text. It also may have difficulty rendering faces and people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many WordPress content use cases, the Stable Diffusion model should be adequate for illustrating posts and creating unique featured images. Batdorf plans to add the following features in future releases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use an existing image as starting point</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add an image mask to only generate specific areas</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help with prompt ideas and inspiration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run multiple image predictions at once</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have more control over the image generation steps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>View your prediction history</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Model selection from collections</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Diffusion plugin is a personal side project for Batdorf and he doesn&#8217;t plan to turn it into a commercial plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are no plans to lock any features behind a pro or premium plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All features will be added to this version on wordpress.org. Over time I plan to add all features supported by Replicate, as well as additional features for the WordPress community specifically.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, Batdorf said users who find the plugin useful can support its continued development by <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/KevinBatdorf\">sponsoring the project on GitHub</a> through monthly or one-time contributions .</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 04:23:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: SiteGround Launches Managed EDD Hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137952\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/siteground-launches-managed-edd-hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1829:\"<p>SiteGround launched a new <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/edd-hosting\">managed Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) hosting product </a>today, the first of its kind among WordPress hosts.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

Today, we are going to talk about Gutenberg 14.1, WordPress 6.1, and a lot of good design tools. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time contributor to the WordPress open-source project. And, today, I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me, as co-host, Channing Ritter, from the WordPress design team and design director at Automattic. Good afternoon, Channing. Thank you for joining me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We have been trying to do this together for so many months. So happy it&#8217;s worked out today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m really excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. So what have you been working on at Automattic right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> I have been working a lot on the 2023 default theme that&#8217;s coming up soon with the 6.1 release. It&#8217;ll be released alongside 6.1 in November. So it&#8217;s been a really, really interesting process. It&#8217;s different than the way we&#8217;ve previously done the default theme, in the sense that it&#8217;s been very collaborative with folks all across the community helping design the theme and designing different style variations that will get bundled with the theme. So it&#8217;s been a really interesting process. We&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So how many submissions did you get?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: We got 38 total. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow. Yeah. For a first time, that&#8217;s really cool. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Very cool. And they&#8217;re amazing submissions as well. If you go through the repository and just glance through what people submitted, they&#8217;re so creative. They&#8217;re so unique, and everything&#8217;s really pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in the editor currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. We will show in the&#8230; We&#8217;ll share, in the show notes, the link to the repositories so, dear listeners, you can go and kind of browse around, get your own creativity going. And, also, is there a process for, or thought about a process for, the ones that don&#8217;t make it into the default theme because there were only 10 that make it? What happens with the others? Is there a way to download them, upload them, or something like that? Or what would be a good process to also use them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: There should be. We haven&#8217;t quite figured out what it will be yet, but it sounds like it might be a child theme or some way of showcasing all these amazing submissions. Because, like you said, there&#8217;s so many cool ones. And we really are only moving forward with 10 that will get bundled with the theme. But I think folks would definitely love to be able to play with all of the submissions because there&#8217;s some great stuff there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. I know that Justin Tadlock plans to do a child scene with that, with his variation, and maybe bundles others as well. So we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: His submission rough draft was really great. I really enjoyed his submission especially.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Well, thank you for going through this with me. So the first announcement that we have is, of course, yesterday&#8230; No, September 13th, the release team was on a recorded public Zoom call to discuss what features will make it into WordPress 6.1. And, of course, the recording is available now on WordPress make blog. I will share it in the show notes. But, also, the team gave us an outline of what will be coming in 6.1. And so, at the start, Matias also walked us through the default theme, with the various style variations. But what else is going to be in WordPress? Is there anything that stands out for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I really enjoyed the product demo, by the way. I know it was very cool to see Matias demo-ing 2023, but also showing how 2023 will interact with some of the new features that have been built into the editor at this point. He especially showed&#8230; One thing I thought especially cool was the zoomed-out view, where you can kind of zoom out and see the full template and kind of interact with things at a container level. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to make it into 6.1 because it&#8217;s still flagged as an experimental feature, but it was so cool to see that and how he was interacting with the style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can really get a sense of the different style variations in that view because you can see so much more of the template. I thought that was very, very cool. And then also tons of interesting new design capabilities that we&#8217;re also playing with in 2023, for example, the fluid typography and the spacing presets. It&#8217;s been really cool to experiment with those in 2023. And I think it&#8217;ll give folks a good example to kind of go out and start using those new features, just kind of referencing what was done in the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Especially the fluid topography really puts responsiveness right into the editor and to the front end without having to think about view ports or think about other considerations. It just kind of scales if the theme actually happens to use those things naturally. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, yeah, there will also be the new version of the quote block that we talked here on the show about, where you can add inner blocks to the quote block. So you can put a heading in there and images and paragraphs and lists. And then there&#8217;s also a new version of the list block, where each list item is now a block. And you can navigate that a little bit better with up and down. There were also quite a myriad of changes to locking things that started with 6.0, but now it&#8217;s expanded into patterns. You can lock certain blocks and patterns, and you can lock the child. There&#8217;s this: Apply these locks to the blocks inside the container block. And then so these content locks for blocks is really expansion of that. Do you know how that&#8217;s going to work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. So I think this one is super interesting. And, like you said, the first kind of iteration of locking controls was released with 6.0, but those were more&#8230; It was almost like a blunt instrument for locking. You could lock down things like movement or removal of a block. But the content lock is such a more nuanced locking control. Right? Because you can lock down the general structure of something, like, say, a pattern, but then restrict the editing capabilities so that folks can&#8217;t kind of take apart the pieces of the pattern. But yet they can still get inside to edit text, make copy tweaks, change out images, that sort of thing. So you have a lot of control over the general structure and the attributes of the pattern, but folks can still get in there and make edits. So I think it&#8217;s a really interesting evolution of the locking controls that were introduced in the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s also a merging of two concepts, one that was in the block editor from the beginning, which was a reusable block, which always tripped a few people up. Because they changed it, and then they changed it all over the site, in that they used it as a pattern, where patterns weren&#8217;t available. And, instead of kind of converting it to regular blocks and then changing, they changed the reusable block, and it was the same over the whole site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think combining those two concepts is probably further down the line, where, yeah, things can be locked down for content or for structure and styling and be a little bit more granular in the lock pieces. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I also think it&#8217;s interesting the way that both the zoomed-out view and the content lock are kind of moving towards the same idea of this container-first editing. It&#8217;s been a real pin point we&#8217;ve seen over the past many releases, is that folks struggle with these kinds of complex block structures, where you have a lot of nested inner blocks. And it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve seen people really struggle with. Especially, in June, we did user testing, as a part of the full site editor outreach program. And we paired with folks and kind of watched them try to make changes in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was something that, over and over again, you see folks struggling with that. They think they&#8217;ve selected a certain level. They think they&#8217;ve selected the parent. But they&#8217;re not actually on the parent and are accidentally changing the wrong level of block. So I think that&#8217;s an issue that we&#8217;ve been trying to come at, from the product design side, of trying to solve that in many different ways. And I think both the zoomed-out view and the content lock are interesting kind of simplifications of the editing process. And the container-first approach, I think, could go a long way towards just general usability and making it super easy to make changes without trying to dig through and figure out which level you&#8217;re at, or are you editing the right block, and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I can see that, yeah, even just thinking about a parent and child kind of concept. And how do you get to the parent when the toolbar then, all of a sudden, changes? And then you&#8217;re looking for some controls in the sidebar, but you have selected the wrong block. Yeah. I can see that. Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some usability there. Sometimes, it&#8217;s also just the complexity of, all of a sudden, you have so much more freedom that these concepts need to be learned first before you even can manage your freedom well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting balance to strike with the interface there. Yeah. And we will have, of course&#8230; What we talked here quite a bit was also for 6.1. There will be more templates available to the site builder, or site owner, to get through the template interface, where you can add new templates for authors and for&#8230; We had the authors and some others. But now it&#8217;s also for custom post types. You can do it for single categories. So you can have, on your site, a category WordPress, a category travel, and a category personal notes. And each one of them can have a different styling on their summary post or on their single post blocks. So that&#8217;s going to be a real change for the capabilities of WordPress at all. Because, before, you actually needed a developer to implement those template changes. And now you can do them all yourself, when you have additional block custom prototypes that are available through plugins and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Agreed. Those are really big changes. And I think we saw a lot of changes there, in 6.0, which kind of expanded template creation capabilities. And it&#8217;s cool to see that continue into 6.1, with it just getting more and more refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then there will also be some developer focused changes, or features, in there. There&#8217;s the big style engine revamp of the consolidation of classes and styles and style variables. Then the team has been working on PHP hooks for the theme JSON file. And, also, there is also a call for testing out, but there&#8217;s also an elements API that, right now, I think, only goes through the theme JSON, where, for any heading, you can have a setting, a styling, in the theme JSON file, without identifying the block or the blocks where those could be used. The same with links and other on buttons. There you can have a general kind of styling for those. And then there will be also settings for the captions, yeah, like the embed. The images have captions. Galleries has a caption. And the embed blocks have captions. And those were only&#8230; You only could do, I think, bold and italics and a link in there, but now you can actually add more settings to them or styling to them but only through the theme JSON. The user interface hasn&#8217;t been built yet, I don&#8217;t think, even designed yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I think you&#8217;re right. It tends to go that way. Right. The capability is added in theme JSON first, and then get around to adding some UI there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like that because then you can actually see what people do with it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there will also be, in the 6.1, a feature where you can use block-based template parts in classic themes. And we have been hearing that quite a lot that, for the classic themes, or those that have doing hybrid themes, if they could gradually adopt block themes, or full site editing, by giving a certain feature, opening up certain features for classic themes. And the template parts have been merged into Gutenberg 14.1 and will be in the beta next week for 6.1. And there is a call for testing and feedback about using it because it&#8217;s the first version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as you know, the first version is never really built out. It kind of does the most important things. But what else is needed? And does it even work? The developers have envisioned that. So it offers you, yeah, as I said, gradual adoption. And it&#8217;s full set editing. Agencies have requested that. And that needs to be testing before we go into release candidate, which is beta. Beta one is September 20th. And then, three weeks after that, which&#8230; Release candidate is on October 11th. So it would be good if your feedback would come in before October 4th, for the last beta, to make some changes to that. And I think that…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: This is a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: This is a perfect feature for a full site editing call for testing, in my opinion. It&#8217;s just such a major feature. Like you said, it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve talked about for a long time. And, obviously, we want to encourage folks to be adopting site editing and all the amazing new capabilities that are possible. And it kind of is an easier barrier for entry or lowers the barrier for entry. And it gives folks an easy way to try it out with their classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it also gives a perfect opportunity for agencies to talk with their customers about one thing that they can offer to them that they can change, like headers, or footers, or maybe sidebar items. So they can both, clients and agencies, can kind of figure out what&#8217;s the balance between being locked down and giving freedom. And I like that. Hopefully, we get quite a few feedback on that before it makes it to 6.1. We also are certainly happy to get the feedback afterwards. But then the change might not happening until 6.2, which is not yet scheduled. But it will come in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That 6.1 is the last major release in 2022, yeah, while we are at it. So I can repeat the dates again. Beta one is September 20th. The scheduled release candidate is, right now, scheduled for October 11. And then the final release is scheduled for November 1st, in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Coming soon to a WordPress instance near you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That brings us to the community contributions of this show. And I have two things. And some of you probably have already heard about it, either through Gutenberg Times or through Twitter. So I had a conversation with Artur Grabowski from the Extendify team, and they have a new product they work with, called Launch. And they work with hosting companies to install the most modern onboarding experience for WordPress customers of the hosting companies. Hosting companies did some research, and they have a relatively high churn rate on 50% of customers leaving for an SAS for software as a service, CMS, also a locked one. And Launch, the Extendify Launch, should help them to help those WordPress customers to onboard. And they give them very personalized information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They ask for the goals for the industry and then have images and copy that is already kind of usable for those verticals and then also have a simultaneous integration for the WordPress instance. Give them a to-do list on: Yeah. What&#8217;s next? Write your about page. And here you need to have your contact form and also include a&#8230; They don&#8217;t include yet anything for third party page builders. But this is so important, when you have ever seen someone who installs WordPress on a hosting company&#8217;s site and then is greeted with a WP admin dashboard. Many people are lost and don&#8217;t know what to do next. And, most of the time, it&#8217;s kind of installed at page builder, which, yeah, it&#8217;s not kind of&#8230; And then they&#8217;re lost for WordPress entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. That sounds like a great project. I can&#8217;t wait to check this out actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It did. So I only saw a demo. I didn&#8217;t get my hands on it yet. But it&#8217;s also very, very new. So they just started talking with the hosting companies. I will share the link in the show notes, so you can check out their website and see what they have planned there. The second interesting conversation&#8230; I had many, many interesting conversations at WordCamp US. And one got really my attention. One was with Aaron Edwards. He demonstrated an early beta version of the Imagine newest product, which is a plugin that brings the magic, as they say, the magic of AI image generation to WordPress. So you give a prompt for an image generation API through that plugin, like a young female assembling blocks in the right corner of a car repair shop kind of thing. And then you get a set of images back indicated. So, in the interface, you can indicate which painter you wanted to kind of feel like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I selected the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. And, in the second set, the Spanish painter Salvador Dali. And it was really interesting to see how that topic kind of changes with the different styles. And, if you haven&#8217;t yet looked, the featured image on the latest post. Weekend edition 2028 actually has an image, a featured image that was AI generated through that plugin. I just heard this morning&#8230; And we are recording this on September 15th. &#8230; That the plugin is now available through the repo. So I will add it to the show notes. Right? Fresh from here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So have you played with any imaging AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ve been playing with Midjourney a lot, way too much. It&#8217;s hard to tear yourself away once you get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really addictive. And Midjourney has-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Have you exceeded your free hundred points or whatever it was?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yes. I immediately upgraded. It was really cool. I mean, obviously, there&#8217;s a ton of cool things that could be done with this new technology and WordPress. So I&#8217;m really excited to check out this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Me too. And I&#8217;m glad that it comes to WordPress all the cool stuff as well because it&#8217;s such a&#8230; Because they used CMS. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I keep having this idea floating around, in the back of my mind, that the jet pack image compare block would be so cool for trying different styles, if you use the exact same prompt but changed the painter, or the art movement, that&#8217;s inspiring the style. And then you could have the image compare block and sort of slide across and see how similar, different the different images are that&#8217;s on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good idea. For demonstration purposes, we can kind of do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this plugin, also, when you give the prompt to it&#8230; And it takes about&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. &#8230; 30, 40 seconds. It&#8217;s not instantaneous. But it&#8217;s very&#8230; You can wait for it, and the anticipation increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then you get four images back. And then you can refine them. And Midjourney has that same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Where you can refine it, and then you can upscale a portion you like, and then you get more details in it. It&#8217;s just, yeah, phenomenal what this does. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And they&#8217;re so much more impressive after you upscale, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Which one was it? I think&#8230; Was it 2027? I spent one morning, on a Sunday, on Midjourney, and I actually had an image in 2027. And 2027 was with Midjourney. And then 2028 was with that plugin. So you already can compare two things right there. Yeah. So, now, from the cool stuff to the cool stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 14.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s released? We are looking at the Gutenberg plugin release 14.1 with 59 contributors. And seven of them, new contributors, merged 348 PRs in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a huge number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> That&#8217;s a huge number. I love when you&#8230; The Gutenberg releases, the last few leading up to a major WordPress release, are always so epic. There&#8217;s so many things getting merged at the last moment. It&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And, yeah, no, don&#8217;t fear. We are not going to go through 348 PRs today. There were a lot of PRs that we&#8217;re cleaning up some of the code, or merging something, or migrating something over to a different type script or to switch out Lodash for performance reasons. So that, of course, also contributed to a fair number of PRs. So, yeah, do you want to do us the honor and kind of dive right in into the change log?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. So let&#8217;s start with the zoomed-out view that was added to the site editor. We just chatted about that briefly because it was demoed during the 6.0 walkthrough earlier this week. But it is one of the most exciting things, I think, going into this release. And, like I said, it&#8217;s always exciting when you&#8217;re getting close to a major release, and you have all of these features that have been cooking throughout the release cycle. And then you want to try to get them in. Even if this is going to remain experimental for a while and probably not go into the major release, it&#8217;s still really cool to be able to try it in the plugin. So this is something you have to go into the Gutenberg experiments page and actually enable it. So some folks might miss that. You have to turn on this feature in order to be able to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as we mentioned, this is a more container-first approach to editing. It kind of does this really nice zoomed-out effect, where you can see more of the template, above the fold on the page, makes it really easy to select, at a container level, and move around entire sections, really easy to insert new patterns as a new section. And you can imagine that this is just a really easy way to rapidly build out a template from preexisting patterns and making it really easy to, like we were saying before, not get lost in the little granular inner blocks. And you&#8217;re looking at more of the big picture layout structure of your template in this view, which I think is incredibly helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you can then also scroll through, or browse through, all the templates that are on your site and kind of compare them and see what is the same and what is different, just in a great smaller view. But you see the full page of that. So I really like that. Yes. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And another major one, which we also touched on briefly, is the new content locking experience. I had worked a lot on the block locking tools that were released with 6.0. And we had actually tried a couple things around content locking. For example, we tried something on the reusable block, where it would add kind of a click-through overlay. But you wouldn&#8217;t be able to click through the overlay. The overlay would kind of block you from being able to edit the content inside. And I think that was an interesting approach, but it was more of a blunt instrument. And, once we started testing that and looking at how it worked, it occurred to us that, actually, folks probably need to be able to edit some of the content inside. And you don&#8217;t want to remove all of the editing capabilities. You just kind of want to restrict it. So this is a much more nuanced approach, and I&#8217;ve been playing around with it a lot. I think it&#8217;s working really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Looking forward to that. Yeah. As I said, it&#8217;s the kind of reusable block going to be merged into this idea. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. And then, also, lots of design tools improvements. I think we&#8217;re seeing a lot of typography support being added just across tons of different blocks, with the goal being to get the design tools to a place where they feel really consistent across different blocks. And, if you interact with topography in a certain way on one block, then you go to a different block. It should be familiar. And you should recognize, see, the same controls there. And a ton of PRs in this release. Is this right? Twenty-two more blocks have more typography support enabled. That&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, last release, it was 30. So we&#8217;re coming to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think they&#8217;re 80 blocks. Well, no, 50 blocks about, in there. And I think it&#8217;s now finished with that. In the same round, we&#8230; The typography consistency, typography being available consistently over all the blocks where you need to change the font. Also, the same is true for the spacing supports for blocks. So you can have dimension controls and padding and margin. And you can also step through that and have step sizes there. And it&#8217;s now also available for the gallery block for the common block category list and other blocks, like it was also from the previous release. It&#8217;s a continuation on that. And then what&#8217;s also has been&#8230; And Matias actually demonstrated that also, in the walkthrough of 6.1, that the transformations are gotten a little bit chaotic because they&#8217;re also considered&#8230; Which were mostly used or less used blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you could get an interesting listing of what you can transform a block to. And now there is a decision made that the most used blocks, like paragraph list and quote&#8230; You can kind of have them on the top of the list of all the transforms. So you have always those available, and other blocks actually get additional transformations in this release. The code block can now be transformed to a mere paragraph block, which wasn&#8217;t available before. And, back to the spacing, columns block now also have the axial blocks, X-E-L, block spacing. So you can have spacing on one side of it but not on the other, like you can also do with images. Yeah. You can have a radius on one side, but the others are corners, normal corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. Right. These consistency improvements, I feel like they go such a long way with usability, especially for newcomers who are trying to learn how to use Gutenberg. And it is really helpful, right, if you learn how to change a setting on one block. You come to expect those settings, and you know exactly where to find it. It&#8217;s really nice to see all this movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It really came out great together. And there was a ton of improvements, also, to the navigation block. And I just want to highlight two of those. And you are more than welcome to talk about the others if you wanted to. So there is create a classic navigation menu as draft and for the site editor. So, if there is&#8230; That&#8217;s certainly something to have the migration process from old to new a little bit smoother, that, when you have a classic menu that you wanted to use and that you can go back and forth with it. Not quite sure how that&#8217;s going to work, but it&#8217;s definitely something that has been missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Yeah. Definitely smoothing out some rough edges with the navigation block. All of these improvements are little iterative tweaks, but they go a long way towards just making that block feel like more intuitive, like a little smoother to use. I love a few of these. This adding the animation when you open the overlay, I think that&#8217;s so cool. It feels super smooth when you do it. And, even just fixing the position of the X overlay, or the X icon, so it&#8217;s in the exact same position as the icon you use to open the overlay, those are the small tweaks that designers obsess over. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Right. Right. But that make it so easy to spot it when it comes out. And you kind of see it when you&#8217;re using it. Yeah. And now you can even select a different icon for your mobile menu button on that, so…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I love the new icons. Those are great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It doesn&#8217;t have to be a hamburger. It also can be something else. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Those are great. Collectively, all of these improvements to the navigation block, they just make it so much more like customizable and more pixel perfect. I&#8217;m really happy to see all this movement happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The designers are really very happy about that. And here&#8217;s one that I like very much that&#8217;s in the block editor: When you add a link to a paragraph or so, or to a section, and it shows you the latest post and pages in a dropdown box, and now each one of them gets a different icon, so you can distinguish easily by icon: Is it a page? Is it a category page? Or is it a post? So I really like that because then you are sure. Just, if you have a post on a page that have similar titles, yeah, it kind of hard to find the right one, if you don&#8217;t have additional clues in there. So I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. It is really helpful. I had never really thought about it before, but the addition of the icons is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Especially also because there is this new keyboard shortcut. I don&#8217;t know how new it is. It must be maybe two or three Gutenberg versions before. When you want to do an internal link, you can do just two left brackets, square brackets, and then it gives you a list of all the posts, and you can search on it. And there you will find that too because they use the same component there. So it&#8217;s really interesting to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Nice improvements there. And then we also have some great improvements in this release around patterns. So one of them was post type restriction API for patterns. I believe that&#8217;s where you can restrict patterns that are being inserted based on the post type. So, if you had a really specific post type, like books or something like that, you could have particular patterns that will only appear for that particular post type, which gives a lot more control over what can be inserted there. And another one was allowing remote pattern registration in theme JSON, when core patterns are disabled. I think this was a request from the theme developer community, who would like the ability to disable the core patterns but still be able to include specific patterns from the pattern directory. So, again, more nuanced controls there, which is very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s more like a curation. Even if it&#8217;s not your own patterns, you can kind of select the best five patterns that you think, as a theme developer, those are good to have, and they fit your theme as well. Then you can have them included in the pattern inserted without enabling all the other 800 patterns that are in pattern directory. And-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff in the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: But you do have to kind of search around to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There is a little bit of a quality kind of&#8230; I think we should do a little bit more curation there, in terms of quality of the patterns, but some&#8230; It&#8217;s just how it is, yeah, when the community comes in. You have all qualities, from low to high and in between. And some are cool, but you would never put it on a business website. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: True. True.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s amazing to see how many are there, considering there wasn&#8217;t even a pattern directory maybe a year ago. And just how many community submissions have been added there. It&#8217;s amazing. There&#8217;s a ton of things to choose between. I use it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So we didn&#8217;t talk about that. But are there additional patterns that would come with the default theme that you remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> I don&#8217;t think so. I think we were kind of looking at&#8230; The general approach to the default theme was: Take 2022, and just strip out the opinionated aspects of it, and just make it kind of like a blank canvas approach. And I think we were thinking something similar with the patterns, like almost the exact same patterns as 2022, but maybe strip out some of imagery and whatever else might be included there. I haven&#8217;t really taken a close look at that, but it&#8217;s probably getting to time where we should be taking a look at that. Good reminder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And then. Let&#8217;s see. One more thing that was added here. This is to global styles, adding outline support for blocks via theme JSON. That&#8217;s very cool, to give the ability to control the outlines there on buttons and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But it&#8217;s only for the theme JSON right now? No UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: No. Ah, right. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s graphic interface, that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Always good to start there. Let&#8217;s see. And then also theme JSON addition is the ability to style citations. So that was not previously possible. And citations, of course, appear across many different blocks, including, quote, pull quote. So just a little bit more nuanced control there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know quite a few people add that to their normal text. Yeah. They go to custom HML and then put site in. So now this can be styled as an element as well through the theme. So that&#8217;s really&#8230; It&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And, yeah, there&#8217;s also a filter for inner blocks for the navigation block that was added. So developers, like plug-in developers, can add additional menu items to the navigation block without having to worry about the interface for users. A use case for that is to add, for instance, a log out or log in menu to a navigation menu when it&#8217;s necessary. If you want to have just a subscriber only thing, or it&#8217;s for membership plugin or so, that can be added to the navigation block. It took a while to get this in because there was this kind of hesitation to bring something into the block editor without a user interface. But there&#8217;s definitely a use case that Andy Fragin had for it. It was really quite plausible and got approved and merged into this release. So it will be available for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then Grzegorz also worked on the input that&#8217;s more developer oriented, of course, as well, to input individual blocks to your plugin, or, yeah, app, instead of completely input the library. So you can target specific blocks that&#8217;s for your app. And then, another for the block API, there&#8217;s now a render field for the block JSON that will allow you to point to a dynamic block rendering template on your theme or plugin that you need. So you don&#8217;t have to register your rendering page separately. You can just kind of take it from the block JSON meta field, and that&#8217;s now enabled. Yeah. And then we are going to get past a lot of back fixes and back fixes and back fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: A lot. A lot. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A lot. Yeah. Good job, team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Squashing those bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And, yeah, you can definitely kind of go, &#8220;Has my bug been fixed?&#8221; Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some hurrahs around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So finally it&#8217;s been fixed. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s been logging the bugs as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Thank you. It&#8217;s such a major important contribution to actually go through the pain. Sometimes, I say to actually test something that is quirky, and make it so you can make an issue on the Gutenberg repo so people can fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s such a big contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And so many of those bugs come out of the full site editor outreach testing. Folks are constantly uncovering just enhancements and finding bugs and just seeing how things could be improved upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Indeed. For all of us, also some for developers, also kind of pointing out some documentation updates that are already available on the block editor handbook&#8230; And that is that the documentation for the block template parts for the theme support for classic editors, classic themes&#8230; That documentation is already in the repo, I&#8217;m sure. We also will have a developer note out when it hits the 6.1. Also, in the call for testing, there are some instructions there, how to test things. So that is definitely a well-rounded feature release. And then another piece of change is that the doc generation script for JavaScript can now handle a SYMS tag. So, changes into packages and other JavaScript tools that are used with Gutenberg components, you can now see since when this particular feature is available in the documentation. That&#8217;s something that WordPress does quite a bit in their reference guides on the backend side. But, for JavaScript, it was always a little bit cumbersome to get this in. So, now, there is a first version of that available, and we&#8217;ll probably see some more usage of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And then, jumping way ahead, we&#8217;re coming almost to the end of the list here. Some updates around themes. We&#8217;ve already talked about block-based template parts for classic themes, which is huge. Do the call for testing that&#8217;s out now. That would be great to get feedback on. Another one that&#8217;s pretty cool is adding the ability to add a gradient overlay for the post featured image block. This was actually something that came up when working on 2023. And someone had submitted a style variation with this idea that you could use a gradient overlay on something like the home template, where you have the post featured image block in the query loop. And, obviously, duo tone is possible there already. But the gradient overlay is kind of a different effect. You can make it a bit bolder. You can play with the opacity there. So it was very, very cool to see that, kind of a rise out of a need. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I think there&#8217;s this long tradition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gradient. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: There&#8217;s a long, long tradition of default themes kind of influencing features and vice versa, and the product design and the theme development kind of informing each other and working in parallel. And that&#8217;s been really cool to see throughout the course of this release cycle. I think that feature, in particular, was something that it was really cool to see that get added and now will be used in that style variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Which is called pilgrimage, by the way. Coming soon with 2023. And then another really cool one is this new justification controls that you can mess with on a constrained layout. And it will give you the ability to kind of add justification to the inner blocks in a container. So you could have them all go left justified or all go right justified. Again, just a lot more detailed, or more nuanced control, than you ever had there before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Or kind of collecting all the nuanced controls and do it in one step instead of 15.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really like that all. That&#8217;s awesome. I think we&#8230; Did we jump over a few things here? Let me look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Sorry. I may have skipped a couple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No problem. No problem. We can always go back. And, oh, there was one thing that I wanted to mention. Was that you can now pass extra query arguments to the rest API for an accurate preview of the extenders for the query loop. So that is something that, if you do want to add additional arguments, then you can add them to your blocks or to your block variation. And so it&#8217;s more like an extension for developers and theme developers, rather than for AI. Woo Commerce uses that quite a bit and others as well. So, yeah, check that out. The PR has quite a few details in there. And that&#8217;s definitely something that will also be in 6.1 and will have a developer out in the field guide, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But prepare yourself for it. And I think there was&#8230; Oh yeah. And global styles data will also be filterable. There is a first version already in there that you can use global styles default, or global styles blocks, or global styles&#8230; So there&#8217;s this four layers of changes from global styles. Yeah. The default one comes with core. And then each block can have additional filter for the global styles and then as well as the third party blocks. And then the theme has an opinion about how their styles. And then the user can change those styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Say, &#8220;Okay, I want a different color. I want a different font. I want a different spacing there. And I want a gradient there.&#8221; And then there are now filters to tap into that, with PHP, to change some of the styling, if there is a need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice. Thanks for explaining that one. I saw it on the list, and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. As always, yeah, it&#8217;s the first version. Try it out. I think it would also be a good call for testing for that. But this was also&#8230; It comes often in conversations that plugin developers don&#8217;t want to do their own styling for things. So maybe a default styling but also&#8230; Except some of the things that are theme JSON and just kind of bring them in. So, the block, that also has a front end version of it, kind of feeds seamlessly into a theme or into a site. So that&#8217;s definitely something that people want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But there&#8217;s a lot of that. It went to multiple iterations and just landed now for 14.1. So it&#8217;s going to be real interesting to see what other people do with it. All right. Yeah. You&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s the end of our change log. Wow. We made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> We got through the full list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It was awesome. Yeah. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Three hundred and forty-eight, was it, changes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Very impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Three hundred and forty-eight in 48 minutes or something. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I love it. This is such a great way to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going into Gutenberg, by the way, because it&#8217;s hard to keep up. Things move so quickly. And so this podcast is such an awesome way to just get the overview, this along with the What&#8217;s new in Gutenberg release posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Oh, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: That&#8217;s definitely how I stay up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. Yeah. No. Now you&#8217;ve been a part of it. And thank you for making the time today. So, if people want to get in touch with you and connect with you, what would be a good place for you to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Probably just on the making WordPress Slack. You can always send me a DM. My username is Critterverse. That&#8217;s C-R-I-T-T-E-R-V-E-R-S-E. I totally love to get DMs from folks. And I have folks reaching out to me all the time, especially about the default theme lately. And I&#8217;m always happy to help point you in the right direction, if you want to contribute to Gutenberg or help contribute to the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Would love to help there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Thank you so much. And I don&#8217;t have anything to remind you about, except for: Okay. Beta is coming out September 20th. And all beta testers are asked to test it with the beta tester plugin. And, as always, the show notes will be published on the Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 73.

It was wonderful. And I hope you do it again sometime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And thank you all for listening.

I am exhausted from the traveling, from talking to almost 100 people in person, from learning tons in talks and then from catching up with family and work afterwards. It was all worth it, of course. It was exhilarating to meet so many friends again after two years, and to make new ones to geek out about WordPress for four days. I am invigorated from the experience, ready to dive into the upcoming release work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday, I recorded the Gutenberg Changelog episode with the delightful and brilliant Channing Ritter from the WordPress design team.

This allowed designers to add padding values to their <code>theme.json</code> files and users to adjust it via the Styles panel in the site editor. However, there was one catch. There was no built-in way to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35607\">allow full-width blocks to stretch</a> beyond any horizontal padding and reach the edge of the screen. It was the bane of many theme author’s existence. Sure, they could write custom CSS solutions to address the problem, but that didn’t solve cases where end-users customized things. Eventually, this <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42085\">issue was fixed</a> in Gutenberg 13.8 and will land in WordPress 6.1.&#8221; </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors have been working on a Distraction-Free version of the editor for the power writers. <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> gave it a whirl and reports on the insights: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-make-progress-on-distraction-free-mode\"><strong>Gutenberg Contributors Make Progress on Distraction Free Mode</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp US, many people had conversations about contributing to WordPress open-source project,  Five for the Future and how new contributors can get started.

Contributors are moving functionality around the Navigation interface to figure out where it works best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu selector has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42987\">removed from the Navigation block toolbar</a> in favor of placement in the inspector sidebar. This was done to reduce the crowding in the block toolbar, which previously stitched together disconnected actions, hampering the user experience. Automattic-sponsored Gutenberg contributor Carlos Bravo published a gif demonstrating the moved menu:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This release also adds new features like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43674\">a select icon for the Navigation block&#8217;s menu button</a>. It&#8217;s easy to see how the interface can get crowded fast when adding new capabilities. This particular enhancement was added to the block inspector under Display. If this method works well, contributors may look into adding the ability to add custom icons next.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo source: Gutenberg PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43674\">#43674</a>  &#8211; Add select icon for Navigation Block&#8217;s menu button\n\n\n\n<p>The 14.1 release also continues the effort of consolidating design tools, adding things like typography and spacing support to Avatar, Button, Avatar, Buttons, Categories List, Comments Links, Latest Posts blocks, and more. This enables easier customization in the editor without the user having to resort to custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month we published an overview of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-make-progress-on-distraction-free-mode\">latest progress on a distraction-free mode </a>for the editor, which included a brief mention of the experimental zoomed-out view that is now available for the site editor. It puts the focus on building and composing patterns, allowing users to move sections around without affecting the inner blocks. Users can build custom templates without worrying about messing up inner blocks. It&#8217;s not on by default but can be enabled under the “Experiments” menu in the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locked patterns with better content locking is also available in 14.1. Features like duotone filters, block alignment, and resizing are now disabled on content-locked blocks, making it easier to keep users from changing the block beyond recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other highlights in 14.1 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Box-shadow support added to theme.json</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Block-based template parts  now available for classic themes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Four new filters to edit the global styles data in PHP</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smoother multi-selection experience</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved block transforms organization with Paragraph, Heading, List and Quote now shown in a separate menu subgroup</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the full changelog in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/16/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-1-15-september/\">14.1 release post</a> for a more detailed look at everything that has changed.

It was named for Thaddeus Beaumont, a character in Stephen King&#8217;s <em>The Dark Half</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new theme features the same <a href=\"http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Albert+Sans\">Albert Sans</a> typeface used in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-releases-bjork-a-free-wordpress-block-theme-for-blogs-and-personal-websites\">Björk</a>, his previous release, supported by <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text\">STIX Two Text</a> in text content. Beaumont was inspired by the design he is using on <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/\">his personal website</a>, which Norén said people have requested he make into a theme. It has that faded paper look that instantly puts the focus on text content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The  demo of the single post template has an elegant design with drop caps, pullquotes, a custom &#8220;Preamble with a separator&#8221; pattern, and a minimal previous/next post navigation at the bottom. The spacing and typography are exquisite in this theme and lend themselves to a bit more of a formal presentation for longform content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Beaumont comes with nine block patterns, which writers will enjoy, as most of them are dedicated to text presentation. The patterns include a long author bio, short author bio, paragraph with drop cap, paragraph with pullquote aligned left,  paragraph with pullquote aligned right, large pullquote, preamble with a separator, wide quote with diamond separators, and a resume full page pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice a discrepancy in how post content appears in the editor, this is a bug in WordPress, not a problem with the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Currently, text will be set in Albert Sans when you edit your content in the Post Editor, despite it being set in STIX Two Text on the front-end,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;This is because WordPress currently doesn’t apply the core/post-content theme.json settings to the Post Editor preview. This <em>should</em> be fixed in WordPress 6.1, which is scheduled for November 1.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beaumont packages 11 different style variations in the Styles panel that can totally change the look of a website &#8211; a couple of different yellows, multiple dark variations, and several subtle variations on the default. Users can select one and further customize the background, text, links, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Since this theme is geared towards writers, it includes seven different layouts for blog archives, which means users can opt for a more visual display using featured images or keep it simple displaying just titles. These different loops are packaged as Template Parts and can be further edited using the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>View the <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/beaumont/\">demo</a> to see how all the pieces work together or check out the <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/\">Matt Report</a>, an early adopter, to see how a podcast is using the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beaumont would work well as a blog, a writing portfolio, or a resume site, but, thanks to the wide world of blocks, it could also be used as a base for nearly any other type of website. Anders Norén has hit another home run with this theme. It is simple and elegant with just 16K of CSS and no JavaScript, visually distinct from his other themes, and designed for readability. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/beaumont/\">Download</a> it for free from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 22:14:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Post Status: WordCamp US San Diego 2022 Experiences — Post Status Draft 124\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=122085\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://poststatus.com/wcus-2022-in-review/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46339:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There are always new people coming in, being embraced and accepted, and being shown the way.</p><cite>Cory Miller</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-15 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Cory and Michelle talk about their takeaways from <strong>WordCamp US</strong>.

My name is Corey Miller. I\'m the publisher at post status. And I have one of our amazing team members, Michelle Frette, who leads our community engagement at Post Status as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we wanted, we were talking yesterday. We\'ve gotten back. I think, I think we\'re starting to recharge and recover, uh, cuz I thought to you yesterday and Michelle and I was like, oh, you had a full-blown experience at WordCamp US in San Diego. And we were talking yesterday and we. Let\'s share our experiences because only 650 people or tickets were sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then give some takeaways. So, uh, Michelle, it\'s good to see you again. How are you</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> doing good to see you? Well, I don\'t, I\'m not back to full voice yet, but, um, my boyfriend says I sound very sexy, so I guess there\'s a win when you have titis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Hey, you didn\'t tell me you had a boyfriend. That\'s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> it\'s, it\'s an outta get off again, so it\'s all good, but it\'s all [00:01:00] good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> well, that\'s awesome. Yes. Um, I know you had the experience like you do these events, um, in community, so well you squeeze, like if it was a lemon, you squeeze every drop. Out of it. and I\'m I admire that. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> well at least every selfie I got as many selfies with people as I could possibly</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> get you did well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So tell me a couple of the experiences that meant a lot to you, and I\'ll share some of mine too, but I\'m, I\'m curious about your highlights because I saw you a couple of times floating around. And, um, yes, but also we saw each other at the huddle, uh, for Post Status\' in-person huddle on Wednesday before. But can you share a couple of things that come to mind when you think about your experience at word camp us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> for me, this was the ultimate community experience. I love big word camps. Don\'t get me wrong. I love when there\'s 2 2500 3000 people there [00:02:00] because the more people that have opportunities at word camps, the better I love when people are learning. I love when people are meeting and connecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I mean, I, I, you know, me, I\'m, I\'m all about community. So I love when many people get an opportunity to do this, this one wasn\'t small. Because people didn\'t wanna come. It was small because it had to be. And so there were also some benefits to that. So I saw the same people more often, which meant that I could make deeper connections than if I just saw 3000 people once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had opportunities to actually sit down and talk to people. I had opportunities to take selfies with people and put them up on Twitter and make those connections that I might not have had if it was a bigger word camp. And so for me, that was super exciting. Now there was a little bit of a drawback and I am gonna write about this, um, this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So depending on when you hear this, it may already be in print on our, our website. Um, there [00:03:00] were some accessibility issues, which kept me from being able to do, um, everything I wanted to do. So for example, I went to the Pagely party. I loved it. I had a blast at the Pagely party, but on that yacht, there was no elevator that went to the top floor now to their credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lily wanted, she wanted to try anything to get me up to the top floor. She\'s like, come on, we\'ll help you. We\'ll help you. And I\'m not, this is not a. On Pagely at any way, shape or form, that party was amazing. And I had a hundred percent blast because I was kind of, I don\'t wanna say stuck, but I kind of was stuck on the main level when you go in, but I was never alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People were aware of the fact that I was. At one level on the, on the boat and came down constantly to check in on me. I felt like I was holding court. I had this table mm-hmm people came down and said, I was never for two seconds alone. And I had deep conversations with people because I could actually hear them vibe upstairs with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might not have been able to have [00:04:00] had that same experience. So. I had a different experience than a lot of people did at the ley party. But for me, it was a better experience because I could hear people, I could have, um, rich conversations. I introduced people to one another that didn\'t know each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the food was amazing by the way. And, and the swag was amazing and I often call style a swag. Um, it\'s a w board, so I won\'t say it on the show, but , uh, I love swag. So we\'ll just say that. But yeah, that, that experience was amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I, I think one thing we were talking about some of these, um, issues yesterday and the value behind it is one I\'ve always loved about WordPress, which is to be inclusive of all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And, um, I, you know, as we\'ve talked and I\'ve heard your story, it\'s made, helped me understand better that if we really want to be inclusive, we need to think about. Everybody we can, everybody that we want to come, which is all. And, um, right. That, [00:05:00] that principle, I think is one thing that helps WordPress state set apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it\'s, it\'s incredible because I\'ve seen things. In WordPress, then I go, I wish we could have that in our broader culture, in my community, in my own life. And it, I, I told the people many times that WordPress leads the way in so many things. And you think about it, we\'re all over the globe doing these cool things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rally around the code, but it\'s really the humans. And yeah, we\'re doing these things that I think are pushing the limits. Our culture that are there, we\'re blowing past those. And we\'re a great reflection as we go into our live in our local communities, across the world to make a huge impact globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s what inspires me about WordPress. And particularly this, this topic is if we can do this right here, then I do it. And I think about it. I think, you know, yesterday you mentioned. You know, the buttons on the doors that come close. [00:06:00] Yeah. Yeah. And, um, I just pulled a handle for myself, but you mentioned to me, you said buttons didn\'t work in certain places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I go, well, well, there was the only, there,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> there were only buttons on one door and the entire venue, and that was to get into the actual conference hall. And one of them didn\'t work. The other, I think, did. But most often I was with somebody who had just opened a door for me, but I was keenly aware of the fact that that was the only time in the entire weekend that I was someplace where I could actually access a building by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I got stuck in the bathrooms, I guess I couldn\'t get out of the bathroom, uh, without help because of the way the door opened in and the way that my mobility device is, you know, situated to be able to reach in front of me and open a door and back up. And, and I was, I have a motorized, um, Mobility device, but people who are in wheelchairs might have had even more of a difficulty because you\'re trying to maneuver your chair by [00:07:00] yourself and open a door at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I became keenly aware of the fact and there I was not the only person using mobility devices there. I saw at least two other people in wheelchairs and. It made me keenly aware of the fact that we were, we had a more difficult time participating fully because if we wanted to access a space, we needed assistance to actually open the door, to get into the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And opening doors is something that should be so simple. It should be easy. We shouldn\'t have that kind of di.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, one thing I took away from that is, um, now I\'m aware of it, which I think is a, a good first step for all of us. And now I\'m gonna be testing buttons and looking for those work , which I probably won\'t hit a, hit another door now thinking where\'s the button and secondarily does the button work so right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, I think. Something we, you have in particular championed at post and in the WordPress community is diversity, [00:08:00] equity and inclusion. And, um, it\'s something that I\'ve become increasingly more aware of. And I think all of us out there want to make the difference. So next word can\'t be seen or next anywhere you see, Hey, Is there a way for someone to access that building, uh, in a mobile device and second is, does the button work and that\'s something that right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we can share and be a part of and make a difference in. So thank you for sharing that yesterday and today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh, it was other, I mean, other than that, yeah, those were speed bumps, if you will. Um, but other than that, the, the, the event was phenomenal. Uh, The rows were wide enough for people to roll through, uh, the sponsor sometimes in a, in the sponsor area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have thousands of people crammed in it\'s impossible to even walk through. This was open an airy. There was plenty of space for people to get two [00:09:00] tables to talk to vendors. And sponsors. And I thought that, um, that that part was done incredibly well. The speakers, uh, seemed to have everything they needed on stage to be able to present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that people were watching from home because I got pinged from people saying, you know, oh, I just listened to so and so, and they were awesome. Um, and so I think that overall. I mean, I would say this event was a win for sure. Um, but we do have some things we still need to work on going forward, but you know, nothing\'s ever perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let\'s work on those things and make it even better. Next time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It\'s just like software, you know, when I was a part of teams that were building software, you go, I, I remember one of the best developers I\'ve ever worked with Christine. You said there\'s, there\'s no software without a. And that\'s that\'s with life too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s something out there that we need be talking. And I think this is a great way for us to put it on our community roadmap, so to speak mm-hmm and our next versions to start asking the questions and making [00:10:00] sure it is inclusive for all. And so this is a, a great way for me to understand that. And I think that\'s a part of empathy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy is I have not had, I have not had to use a mobile device. I have not had to use those button. but now I know somebody that I love and care about that has, and my awareness shifts totally into, okay. Awareness. I want Michelle to one be with me. If I\'m, if I\'m there, she, I want her with me or I wanna be with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah. That\'s great. One thing, you know, one thing that really stuck out to me is, um, it\'s we have this amazing community, but there\'s these dichotomies or duality to it. It\'s a community, but it\'s also an industry. It\'s ministry, but it\'s also, uh, community it\'s code, but it\'s also humans. And the code mm-hmm is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t get me wrong. I\'m so thankful for the code. It\'s changed my life. Absolutely. Without the humans. [00:11:00] It\'s just code sitting on a server somewhere without humans using the code without humans traveling to San Diego. I met someone, one of our members all the way from Romania. I mean, taking time away from their families, their businesses, um, their lives to be here at this special event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it rekindled and me Michelle, this what it\'s all about, and this isn\'t for anybody external it\'s for me. Is, uh, I think some, at some point I I\'ve, I lost sight that in all of the things that go on around WordPress, which is so much, we just try to capture some of it for our members. Mm-hmm but. That I can get so wrapped up in these things and forget like it\'s about human experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I know we\'re gonna talk about the huddle in just a second. Mm-hmm but I\'ll to save that for a second, I\'ll say that, you know, yeah. I didn\'t look at the attendee list. I had things that I wanted to accomplish. People I wanted to meet and [00:12:00] talk with building those relationships, deepening those relationships, like you said, but, um, so I got there on Wednesday and I thought I\'m just gonna rest up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I got a text from a dear friend, Kareem who runs crowd favorite, great enterprise agency and member of Posto too. Hey, you have dinner plans on Friday. And I was like with you and he\'s been a long time friend of mine, but I didn\'t think about cream and all the dear friends that I\'ve had over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we got to have dinner and with about 10 of us and just good people. I\'ve long known for a long time. And it lit the fire back in me of what this thing is all about. And, and, you know, honestly, Michelle, I needed a reminder. I needed the rekindling. Gosh, everything I\'ve done in and around WordPress has always been about the people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amazing, absolutely that are a part of this community and your experience reflects it too. You know, seeing that you\'re like, right. You, you were the social [00:13:00] butterfly, you you\'re everywhere. You never met a stranger in your life. I am more introverted and I\'m. Okay. This O this is overwhelming sometimes even at 650 people mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but that little spark for me was a great reminder of it\'s really not just about the code, the code\'s awesome. Um, but right, but it\'s really about the humans, the people, the experiences with those people. I often</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> refer to the WordPress community as an open source community. So we have open source software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s an open source project, but the community is open to, right. So we\'re open to each other. Um, do I love every single person in the WordPress community? There are some, I love more than others, right? Because we\'re all human beings and I\'m sure there are people who look at me and go, I don\'t even care to know her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m okay with that too. Right. I\'ve always said I\'m not everybody\'s cup of tea. And that\'s okay. But we always just, even, even, so even if there\'s somebody who just like greats you the wrong way, it\'s [00:14:00] like pet the cat the wrong direction. Right. Even if there\'s a person that we still treat each other with respect and we give each other the room to be, um, successful in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s one of the beautiful things about WordPress. There was, um, Uh, Mark West guard from Ws forum. My Travis tots from gravity form took a picture arm wrestling, like who\'s got the vendor for. Right. And what I love about it is they\'re posed with their arms straight. In the picture and they just like, who do you think won?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the answer is they both win, right? Because they don\'t tell you like, oh, somebody was stronger than the other because let\'s face it. Everybody exists in this space. And even though Ws form and gravity form, technically are competitors. They both want each other to be successful because that\'s who we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the space. We don\'t have just one form plugin. We don\'t just have one host. We don\'t just have one donation software. Like there are, um, competitors, but they all cheer for each other too. And I think that that\'s [00:15:00] truly amazing part of our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And I I\'ve told people so many times I have the best job because when Brian approached me and we started talking about becoming a partner and eventually, um, buying post status, the biggest thing that stuck out to me is together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s the people that, that do WordPress, professionally that have been my dearest friends for 15, 10, 15 years, whatever it\'s been. And I go. Wow. I get to cheer lead and encourage everyone so that everyone does win. I think sometimes that that\'s a good reminder. I think for all of us is sometimes we get locked into the arm wrestling in my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go, I think I know who won no offense to the other, but that. Example is perfect, is that we don\'t have to beat someone else in order to win that there are ways to collaborate, cooperate. And at the very minimum, the word you said was respect. [00:16:00] And I think that is such a thing that we need to anchor back to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s really about the people and that not there doesn\'t have to be a loser in all of this that we can win together. I count some of my dearest friends over the years as being technical competitors to me. And, uh, it was amazing because we could share life together. And share, maybe share some things around business too, but if anything enrich each other\'s lives and going, you serve a different part that I don\'t serve and maybe we have overlap and that\'s cool, but, um, it\'s the apple IBM to me, or, uh, apple and windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s some people that love windows. And I respect that. Um, and there\'s some people that love apple and I respect that and that they serve different people because we\'re all kind of different. We have our unique perspective on life and that\'s the spirit though. All of this, I want anchor this back, not just as a promotional item, but to post it what we do here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm, why you spend your seemingly AB [00:17:00] you know, not available spare time, helping build. And rally this community together to win together instead of trying to beat each other. And, and that\'s the spirit it\'s so helpful in the slack. And I saw it in person, is people willing to share their experiences, um, and just kind of be good humans to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here\'s the thing I wanna mention too, Michelle. I feel like , we\'ve been two years in seclusion as a species and rightly so, it was the thing we needed to do as a planet. Mm-hmm to survive what happened, but I go, wow. It was just so fun to see the high fives, the hugs, the things that go like we\'ve missed each other we\'ve needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. This cool. This is cool. Zoom is cool, but there\'s nothing like being able to give you a hug at right. You know, in San Diego, it\'s just that elbow to elbow time, um, is so vital in connection. And we need that as humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> There were some people I said, when I see you, I\'m going to give you [00:18:00] an uncomfortably long hug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So be prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I\'m notoriously, I I\'d self-identify as a half hugger, but I\'m starting to warm up and go, okay, let\'s let\'s do the uncomfortable hug. So even the half hug sometimes are me for me or uncomfortable, but I go, that\'s the human spirit. We, we need a touch. We need each other, even if it\'s a high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, and then I\'m little</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> say that I respect people\'s distance. I did not hug anybody that didn\'t wanna be hugged just for the record. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Nick, but Nick Adams got an uncomfortably love long hug and he practically tackled me for it. So it was all consenting. Just</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> let\'s talk about the post huddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, oh my</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> gosh. That was so fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> We\'ve been doing huddles. In fact, we have one going on as we record this and we have one later today. This is a Wednesday, Wednesday is huddle day for us. And we\'re working on different days and times of week to serve our global cult, uh, community. Um, but this was [00:19:00] a blast because even before I got there, cuz I go, it\'s come and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was noon to four, somewhere around there. Um, it was at a, an adjacent golf course where you could walk. I walked at least. Um, but it was close enough to be like, okay, we\'re not going too far off. And the, the people organized, I\'m not sure. I told you this, Michelle, the, the golf club people, cuz we just found this conference, you know, big room that overlooked the gorgeous golf course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, they kept saying they came up to me and they go, are you sure you don\'t want music? I mean, we got Spotify, we\'ve got all these playlists. And I said, no, I don\'t want any music. I said, I promise you in about 30 minutes, it\'s gonna be a dull roar without the music. And now this is my own need too. But I feel like it was reflected too, is like, you\'re gonna get enough music the rest of the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to talk and connect. And the purpose of the huddle was just. Being able to see each other, meet each other in person, perhaps for the first time. And [00:20:00] then when you get out into this huge conference for me, at least, um, to go that\'s my people, that\'s, that\'s my post status community. That\'s who I belong to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was so cool. It\'s like, it just crescendo over time. I like, I didn\'t do a head count, but I go judging by the, the noise in the room. Um, it was such a warm time of connection and camaraderie and just happy to see each other. What were</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> you there were, there were, well there, I would say, you know, I think we had about 80 people, our CP, and I think we had 90 people show up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I think at some point during, I didn\'t count either, but just from the sheer volume of people coming and going, making those connections, sitting down at tables and talking to people, it was. Phenomenal. Um, I was watching people connect. I, I was taking official phone. Oh. Official with my phone. I was taking pictures of groups of people and getting them to, you know, pose for me [00:21:00] so that we could see faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s one of my biggest pet peeves about conferences. Cause people take pictures of groups, but half the group has their back to you. So I\'m like, Nope. Open up. Look at me, take a picture. Cuz we wanna see your smiling faces while you\'re here at our post status huddle. And it was just. Okay. I\'m not a quiet person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that, but I did actually sit back for a minute or two and just watch and listen to other people, connecting with one another. In some cases they were old friends that hadn\'t seen each other since pre pandemic. In other cases, there were people meeting for the first time and really getting to know one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, I mean, it was phenomenal and the hats were a really big hit by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Everybody liked the hats so if you don\'t know, I brought about a hundred hit hits everyone, uh, hats, excuse me. And, and they were a hit. I, I love hats personally. So I geek out with the things I like, but, um, we gave away, I think I only brought a back 15 of those hats and, uh, it was neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just one, you know, I\'m a swag [00:22:00] thing from the other side. I love when people want to wear the community brand, um, and seeing the hats around. But you know, some of the takeaways for me about the huddle, uh, were just the cycle and seasons of life. And. Um, I saw a lot of old friends, friends I\'ve known for years, but then I got to meet a lot of new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s the great thing about WordPress. There\'s always people coming new people coming in, being embraced and accepted, shown the way. Hey, here\'s, here\'s where you can find that here\'s where you can find this. Here\'s how you troubleshoot that, whatever it is. Um, I got to meet a couple that have a marketing agency and, um, Just hearing their story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They started during the pandemic, this is their first word camp. They wanted to come and just kind of experience the community for themselves. And I said, what, what is your, what is your outcome? What do you want to get? And when you take away and get back in your flight and go back to your family, [00:23:00] what do you want from that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was just awesome. They just wanted to. I just wanna connect with likeminded people on the same or similar path. Um, and that\'s, that\'s what the beauty and magic of WordPress in general, but also word, uh, post status. We are trying to say you\'re doing these cool things. You\'re working in WordPress all day, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re building a company in or around WordPress all day, every day. And the magic is that. That\'s why I. It is an industry, but it\'s, mm-hmm, so much more the people that first time come in to WordPress, particularly business people that have been in other industries, they kind of like, look a little shell shocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just smile. I go welcome because , it\'s messy sometimes. Um, because we still are humans, but the, the deep sense is just that there\'s really good people just wanting to do good things in their worlds. Um, and. But I just see the seasonality of it. Some people leave. [00:24:00] I say, don\'t say goodbye to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might say I\'m using another tool, but don\'t say goodbye to the people in the community. That was my thing. When I left, I themes is I said, I, I never wanna say I\'m leaving WordPress. Cause I don\'t want anybody to feel like in that I was leaving my friendships, those end. Um, but then I found myself right back around my season went and I came back around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came back in new I\'m the new new person here. And, um, but that seasons of life thing, and I talked to one of our members too about that is just it, you know, it\'s starting to become fall here in Oklahoma and then it\'ll be winter. And then it\'ll be spring and summer again. And just those cycles and seasons of life really, really matter in that there\'s always a new set of people coming in with bright eyes, a little bit shell shock and going mm-hmm all right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is, this is my people right here, so, and that that\'s magical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It absolutely is. Well, let me ask you a question about, about your time at, at word camp. If [00:25:00] you could say one moment. That really made a difference for you or that was exciting or fun or funny? What would that one moment be</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> funny? Um, deep and memorable moment is just every contact where you just get to hear the excitement in someone\'s voice and love and warmth and care about what they do to other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, One thing I didn\'t get to do. Um, and I wish I had is I believe his name is Alex. He\'s part of our membership. I saw him walking in the, in the, uh, sponsor hallway and I didn\'t get to meet him in person. And then I saw in our slack channel, he was there and I thought, I, I. I had the great desire to meet him, to talk to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, and I didn\'t get that chance, but I hope I, I do soon and others, um, in our community that I just haven\'t got the chance to meet. But one, what did I laugh about? That\'s a good question. I I\'ll have to think on that. I\'m sorry. I\'m trying to think. What, what did I laugh about? It\'s [00:26:00] okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So I I\'ll tell you mine what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, yeah, yeah. There I, there were a lot of fun experiences there. Of course. But my absolute, if I had to say there was one ultimate made me laugh, had a blast with it experience was when Matt Mullen, we called me the busiest woman in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> you laugh because it\'s true. I laugh because it\'s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So well, so, so the funny thing is like, it caught me so off guard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\'t know how to respond. And at first I said, well, maybe, and then I was like, but you have met Josepha. Right. And so I threw it back in his, threw it back to him, but that was a lot of, that was a lot of fun. And, uh, when he came through the, the vendor hall, he, I gave him one of my stickers. I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I gave you one, it\'s a little love who that looks like B, right? Oh yeah. And, uh, and so he took his camera out and took his, took his phone and took his selfie with me and my sticker and, and him, and then he left and I. I didn\'t get that picture. [00:27:00] it\'s on this phone, not on mine. So that was my own little boneheaded moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I should have pulled out my phone too, but, but it was a lot of fun. That was great. This is and meeting with my</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> team. Of course. Yeah. Um, it was so interesting. I guess my last moment was probably a little, a little different in the sense of. In Oklahoma, it\'s hot and humid. I thought, oh, I can\'t wait to get out until I had shorts ready to go and get out to San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, hold on. Something\'s messed up. Oklahoma. When I came back to Oklahoma, I was like San Diego and Oklahoma. Didn\'t realize they swapped weathers. Um, but it was raining the whole time and most of the time, and it caused potential for disruption, but that\'s what it was also reflected in the spirit of just being able to be together and making the most of the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if anything, I was walking to the conference hall vendor, whatever you call the, the main place where word camp was held. And it was just [00:28:00] raining and I did laugh cuz I\'m like, I wanna be soaked by the time I get there, but it\'s worth it. It\'s worth it. Yeah. Little bit of rain\'s not gonna, or a hurricane evidently is not gonna deter us from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, even though it did rain and it was not typical San Diego weather, um, it, it didn\'t deter us as a community. No, it,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> it blew over quickly enough that on Saturday we were a actually able to eat outside for, for the lunchtime. So that was nice. Yeah, but yeah, but it was funny. I thought, are we gonna have to rename this word camp hurricane instead of word camp us, but it didn\'t get that bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you go. It didn\'t get that bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> yeah. I was like hurricane, they have these over here, but the I\'m not crazy. Um, okay. Was there a talk that you were able to go to, um, that stood out to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Um, I was photographing, I was officially there as a photographer and of course, as a sponsor, so I didn\'t get to sit through any of the talks, but, um, so the Q [00:29:00] and a was where I was actually there and listened through the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. What, what stood to you with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that? So what,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> well, what stood up to me was that no question is, is forbidden, right? So it didn\'t matter what question people came with, whether they felt satisfied with the answer or not. I can\'t really say, but. The one thing I did say to somebody who said, well, that wasn\'t really a very deep answer was he didn\'t know you were gonna ask the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like, when you are the person being asked questions, you have to think of the response quickly because you don\'t know what\'s coming. And so if somebody has, you know, submitted questions in advance, like the year that we all kinda submitted questions in advance, that it was online, I think that was 20, 20, the state of the word, you have a much better opportunity to answer more deeply and answer, um, you know, more thorough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when somebody\'s just like rapid firing questions out of the audience, you know, I, I think that he does a pretty good job of being able to respond to those. But, um, the question I asked was about mergers and acquisitions because, [00:30:00] uh, I, I work for a company that has acquired quite a few plugins over the last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I also work at post status where we talk about those and we report on those two. So I asked whether he thought that that was something that was, um, healthy for the WordPress ecosystem or not. Um, I have my own opinion. You know, my own opinion is that we are almost 20 years old next year. We have to, by the way, we have to come up with a, uh, um, a post status birthday party for WordPress next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But WordPress is an ecosystem to, as a product is 20 years, 20 years old next year. And it. A growth pattern that we see in any new industry at a certain point, small businesses will grow large enough that they either have to pivot into, you know, hiring HR and having, becoming these big conglomerates or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They die or they become acquired, they merge with somebody else. And so I, I think that that\'s where we are at as an ecosystem now is that we see these people that grew like, Hey, I, [00:31:00] I think I could build a plugin. And then a couple of their friends join them. And then they start hiring more people before, you know, it, you go from two or three people to 20 people and then it grows and grows and grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you look at yourself and you\'re like, Now I\'m running a business where I just wanted to be a developer. I just wanted to build a plugin, but I have all these people that rely on me for their livelihoods. And so I either have to pivot to be a business owner and not be as much in the code and in the weeds and in those kinds of things and, and learn how to do that and do it well because these people rely on me or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take on a partner or VC capital funding or whatever it is, or look for somebody who can buy you, you can merge and become acquired. And so I think that that\'s where we are in our ecosystem now. And it, and it looks to me like the people who are successful are the ones that find the way to navigate that growth, that pivot point, if you will, that tipping point where they have to do something to continue to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that\'s where we are. And I think that that\'s pretty much what Matt said as well. It\'s that, it\'s how you do it. That really. [00:32:00] Becomes the success of failure, but that we have mergers of acquisitions as a normal part of the growth of</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> our ecosystem. I see. AB absolutely. It\'s the evolution. Um, and we might not always like it at all times, but it\'s part of the, again, the nature of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, absolutely. You know, so many people, uh, I talked to asked, what are we doing? The. Event with postes. And I said, event is a big word for me, huddle something where we get together, do human together. Talk about what we do in the world. As a vocation profession. I talked to a lot of agency owners and there was, uh, a fair amount of agency owners there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Dan, our editor talked to them. I know you did too. And many others, and I. it\'s tough if you love and are really passionate about WordPress and trying to contribute in some way, you\'re probably gonna end up if you can at a word camp. Um, but it\'s tough. You know, our agency, uh, members are out there [00:33:00] building sites, serving clients, trying to make all of this life viable for them and their teams that you mentioned by the way you just shared, uh, previously like my story with I themes and my, our evolution where we eventually sold two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lakewood web now St. WP. And it was really fun to see the brand there, but I said, We, we need something for the people that do client services. We talk a lot cuz you and I are in the product space or I have been in the product space and I go, there\'s so many people out there that don\'t have time maybe for other things that are part of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s one thing I talked to a lot of people about and said, it\'s our intention focus is to find a space for those that do client services and agencies and freelancers to, um, come together, talk shop and it\'s it\'s. Important part of what we do at postes that we want to serve better. And so I\'m talking to a couple of our agency members about specific huddle, just for agencies, [00:34:00] um, agency owners, and, uh, to, to better serve them too, because I\'ve been thinking about this, Michelle, you know, so much of our vibrancy and growth as an ecosystem is really those on the frontier and on the edge building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For themselves, or I\'m sorry, building sites for clients, building word websites or block, whatever it is, membership sites for themselves and their members. And that\'s what I\'m focusing and driving our, our team and post status to do is to better serve that. In addition to the rest of the globe, that\'s not, not able to be in our time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, to go to them as best we can. And if you\'re interested in all that, please P me slack or email Corey at post status. We\'re, we\'re really trying to serve that community better. Um, because I see it\'s an opportunity. I\'m not saying it\'s a detriment, it\'s just an opportunity, um, for us to really serve the people that are helping build that 40, whatever, the percent of the web, [00:35:00] every time I hear it, it\'s bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I love it. Because of those people out there doing the work on the front lines of building, um, the web, the open web. Okay. Michelle, what\'s one thing, one word, one thing you wanna leave us with about word camp, us in the experience. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> my one word. Um, we\'re just, I\'m gonna go with thought that we didn\'t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna, my word is community, because for me, that\'s what it is. That\'s what it was about. And it\'s that connection. So, um, and you don\'t have to go to someplace in person to feel that community in connection. So, you know, if you were of the people that didn\'t get one of those 650 tickets and you had the, the FOMO for not being there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You still have the opportunity within our slack channel on Twitter, um, direct outreach to people. You still have an opportunity to feel and be an integral part of our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I I\'m gonna plus one that, and then add my another one. I thought of, um, that I didn\'t share in this whole [00:36:00] episode, but is I had a fantastic breakfast with Bette who is the WordPress developer advocate and, uh, works with automatic, but for the community and the H highlight was contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she said it so elegantly, like so many people have the desire. To say, I, my life has been changed because the code and the humans here, I want to give back meaningfully, we had such a fantastic conversation around that to really say, I think there\'s a gap here. How this exists over there. It, all of this contribution, it\'s not just about the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there\'s so many people over here that go, I just wanna help, but I, I, I gotta, I gotta figure out how, how to make a meaningful contribution that might not look like some, what somebody else says is that, that manner of contribution, I love Josephus work, leading our community there too. And the things she\'s put out, Angela G and others in baguette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s [00:37:00] there\'s a bridge there that I want post status to help lead the way cuz our members want to contribute meaningfully. And it doesn\'t just mean the code. Um, I\'m not a coder, so, but there\'s so many other ways and she opened my world to possibilities. It\'s conversations. You and I have been having, but I\'ve been having with specifically people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That lead the community is I want Posto to help bridge that, to say here\'s a hundred bridges because they all exist. Right. We just need to say mm-hmm, , that\'s it right here. And she laid out some steps that how she would do it. And I was like, I didn\'t even know that I didn\'t even know that I didn\'t even know that, but she just illuminated my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, we\'ve gotta share this with their members because I know our community has the desire. It just might not mean I get to, I I\'m gonna do a patch or something like that. So much more in the community for overall division is a healthy, vibrant growing WordPress that truly democratizes publishing as we know it in our modern age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Michelle, thanks so much for this [00:38:00] for, for the time. I can\'t wait till our next conversations. I know we\'ve got some brewing coming up that we\'re gonna talk about mm-hmm and just share our perspectives. And as always, we\'d love to hear what you all. Too. And what you\'re thinking about, how you think about it and, um, how close that is gonna be a help in supporting that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thanks Michelle. Hope yours rest recharge.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 18:45:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: Agency Business Brief for the Week of September 12\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=122315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://poststatus.com/agency-business-brief-for-the-week-of-september-12/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5907:\"<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">WordPress Founders Invest in Atarim • Gridpane and Automattic Team Up to Serve Agencies • Salary Transparency — Why Not? • Learning Together in Post Status Slack: Adobe\'s Figma Acquisition and PayPal vs. Stripe </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-founders-invest-in-atarim\">Founders Invest in Atarim</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before <strong>WCUS</strong>, <strong>Vito Peleg</strong> <a href=\"https://atarim.io/blog/atarim-raises-first-funding-round/\">announced</a> <strong>Atarim</strong> has completed <strong>its first funding round</strong> led by <strong>Joost de Valk</strong> and <strong>Marieke van de Rakt</strong>, the founders of <strong>Yoast SEO</strong>, which was acquired by <strong>Newfold Digital</strong> a year ago.

You get all the information, the requirements, the objective, and the deliverables. You know you have the right experience, background, and skill sets for it. It’s a potentially life-changing project for a company with a great global reputation, and as an agency, you’d love to have this client on your roster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>But!&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a big spanner in the works. When it comes to talking proper business, the prospective client refuses to disclose the budget.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your agency explains patiently that without a budget you won’t be able to work out the best solution: you’d be effectively fumbling in the dark, trying to work out how long a piece of invisible string could possibly be. But the client doesn’t care. (I was going to write “won’t budge,” but it’s a bad pun.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re adamant it should be you to come up with the budget in your quote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Out of 11 positions listed on the Post Status job listings page on 27 July 2022, only the one posted by Codeable publishes a range for the rates their freelancers get paid.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way around this is to get the client to pay you to scope their budget. But usually, this kind of client doesn’t understand that this is a valid investment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a consequence, your digital agency has to give up on the pitch because you can’t risk spending time to spec a project without knowing what the budget is. The danger is providing a solution that’s not fit for purpose, getting knocked back for being too expensive, or risking bankruptcy for staying too low.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-always-ask-for-a-budget-don-t-you\">You always ask for a budget – don’t you?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important lesson that I’ve learned from all business coaches I’ve ever listened to, from Chris Do to Michael Killen, is that<em> the first thing that you need to know about a potential client is their budget.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they are not willing to give you a budget, or they tell you they don’t have one, either get the truth out of them somehow or leave the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single time that I have not complied with this rule, it has come back to bite me in the arse.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every. Single. Time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Why do so few of you post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why every good bit of agency and freelancer advice about bidding, sales, and discovery says not to let yourself be treated this way. One brilliant example is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jVkLVRt6c1U\">Mike Monteiro\'s famous &#8220;Fuck you, pay me&#8221; presentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients usually do indeed know what their budget is, and you typically find out when they finally let you know that your price is, in fact, too high. After they’ve received the quote that you spent a lot of precious time very carefully preparing, usually based on a best-case scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thanks for your proposal, but –&nbsp;your quote is out of our budget.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, so you <strong>do</strong> have a budget then!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sure that most of you who are business owners agree with this, and you’ve found yourselves in a similar situation, probably more than once, regardless of the size of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the smaller the business, the worse the consequences. It’s exactly the same for freelance operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you, as an agency owner or a freelance operator, quite rightly do not let your time and resources be disrespected by potential clients – and you demand a budget. Always.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-but-do-you-give-one-yourself\">But –&nbsp;do you give one yourself?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s also see what happens when your agency –&nbsp;the agency that just had to give up on a possibly transformative project for lack of financial transparency on the part of the client – decides to post a job listing for a new hire.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We\'ve all heard about imposter syndrome.  Many people have it or are extremely uncomfortable when talking about money because they come from disadvantaged, even abusive backgrounds. They were led to feel shame about their financial situation from an early age. They sometimes can’t believe they now have skills people are willing to shell out good money for, and they’d rather someone else told them what they’re worth.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You know how important a good team is, and how difficult it is to attract the right fit of talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So your job listing contains a detailed job description, the skills and prior experience required, other qualifications you’d like them to have, and some company history describing your wonderful culture rooted in admirable values with great employee benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But no salary range.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same company that dumped a potential new client for lack of budget disclosure is now refusing to disclose its own budget to job candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a real case scenario, but it could well be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of 11 positions listed on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/jobs/\">the Post Status job listings page</a> on 27 July 2022, only the one posted by Codeable publishes a range for the rates their freelancers get paid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10 other adverts for full-time positions with companies in the WordPress microcosm do not mention any figure – although some do mention that it might be “generous.” A vague term like that could mean anything at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do your adverts post a salary range?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statistically, your answer is very likely to be “NO.”</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img width=\"653\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-edited-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-122204\" /></div>\n\n\n<p>Why do so few of you post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-real-life-example\">Real-life example</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a designer. Design opportunities are mysteriously far and few between in the WordPress microcosm, even though ostensibly everything we do requires a design process, as well as interfaces. As a result, when I want a new collaboration I usually leverage existing relationships, or approach companies that I know could be aligned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, in the spring a fantastic design job listing sprang out of nowhere into my field of attention. It was a full-time position, so not what I was looking for. But it also was one of those unicorn jobs that feel like a perfect fit – as if someone had taken the time to write down the ideal job for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a job so dreamy, that I would even have considered losing my beloved freedom and casting aside my other projects for it. I had only ever come across a job description as coated in fairy dust as this one once before in my life. (And I’m fairly long-toothed by now.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eagerly scanning the job listing page, I skimmed down to the benefits list. They seemed good and generous, and the company is well-known enough for me to trust them. Still, I couldn’t see any numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I scrutinized the page further: nope.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No salary range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seemed like a high-up position as it contained the word “director,” but –&nbsp;in some companies, a “director” is not necessarily a senior position. I’ve known directors who had just left university and were only directing themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I looked at the application form: it required a CV.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have an up-to-date CV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been extremely lucky in the past few years: I haven’t had to provide a CV. My contracts all came from people who’d seen me in action on stage or online, or had seen my work out in the wild, and wanted to work with me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mere idea of updating my CV filled me with dread. I simply don’t have the time or mental strength –&nbsp;especially when I have no idea what the compensation would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found out who the person I should contact was, and I was glad to read the reply “we’d love you to apply!” They also told me that the salary range was very wide based on experience, and they’d be happy to discuss it in the first interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that discussion required the essential prior step of my application – which, even with an up-to-date CV, would still be a time-consuming, emotionally and mentally demanding process. Knowing myself, it usually takes weeks of work (sadly, I am not exaggerating), including research on the company itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pointed out that “without some sense of salary range for someone with my experience, I have no reasonable way to gauge whether the position is the right fit for my level of seniority or not.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never got a reply, ever again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I followed up a few weeks later saying that I know they’re a reputable company, and enquiring whether the position was still open, as it would take me a few days longer to update my CV and portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. No reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really intrigued by this reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know for a fact that I was polite and respectful. All I did was explain why I was asking for a salary range, and why I needed it before the first interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went to the Post Status Slack and asked agency owners in there:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why do so few of you post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That led to a very interesting conversation: especially because every single participant condemned the practice outright. Nobody supported it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, when I checked the listings on the Post Status job board that day, hardly any of them mentioned a salary range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no good living in an echo chamber. I needed to hear from the people who don’t list salaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reasons-why-agencies-and-companies-won-t-post-a-salary-range\">Reasons why agencies and companies won’t post a salary range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went and asked this question —</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>“Why do you not post a salary range when you publish a job advertisement?”</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>— directly to every single one of the companies with a job advert on the Post Status page on 27 July 2022. (Except for Codeable because they do include salary ranges in their listings.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I genuinely wanted to know why this practice has been so widely adopted in our community in particular, and in tech in general. When I was hunting for design jobs in London in the Noughties, salaries were <em>always </em>mentioned as part of the title of the job listing. It was a given.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why has this changed so dramatically?<br /><br />A couple of the companies with a listing on the Post Status jobs page at that time answered with genuinely incomprehensible justifications, so I ignored those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others took the time to give me longer answers where they enumerated all the reasons why they won’t post a salary range. And for that, I am thankful. It appears to show that there are no ill intentions. Everyone means well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, to be honest, even in the case of clearer answers, it cost me some effort to actually distill meaningful reasons from the replies I got. My aim here is to present you with an easy-to-read bullet points summary, but it’s taken me a while to parse the meaning, and I’m not sure I managed it in a few cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is the unsatisfactory outcome of my efforts. In no particular order, here are the reasons why those companies chose not to post a salary range:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It’s hard to put a figure on a job. Too high or too low may filter out the right candidate.</li><li>We do disclose when people who apply ask for the range.</li><li>We won’t list when the spread is potentially very large.</li><li>We won’t list when we don’t advertise that position often, thus being open to discussions based on the promise of the candidate.</li><li>When we are willing to consider a wide range of candidates’ skill levels, expectations can be either too low or too high if we publish a salary range.</li><li>Not posting a range can lead to better candidates applying, so we like that flexibility which can lead to good surprises.</li><li>Conversely, posting a range makes it difficult for us to be flexible when someone has no experience but we can see the potential.</li><li>We used to post a range, but as the vast majority of candidates instantly requested the highest range we stopped. We would always offer less whenever they asked for the maximum amount anyway.</li><li>Salary is a &#8220;personalized requirement.&#8221; Someone who is 40 years old and single and lives in Porto, has different requirements from those of someone who is 40 years old and has a family and lives in New York.</li><li>We ask people to give us their preferred salary range. If we cannot afford the request, we’ll respond with our maximum salary.<br />[see <strong>Oh you do have a budget then!</strong> above]</li><li>We think it’s fairer for people to negotiate their preferred salary than for us to disclose our budget.</li><li>Our salaries vary depending on the location of the employee.</li><li>Market prices have gone up and we don’t want current employees to know that we’re paying new recruits more than them.<sup>*</sup></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>*</sup><em>Reason #13 was given to me privately, by a company that told me in confidence. It is not one of those I consulted for this article. They never posted a job on Post Status as far as I know.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reasons-why-candidates-hate-it-when-you-don-t-post-a-salary-range\">Reasons why candidates hate it when you don’t post a salary range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I felt I had a comprehensive range of reasons why companies prefer not to post salary figures – whether or not I could fully grasp their meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia/status/1556637508112465922?s=20&t=vx_try6voSZShycZB2-BRQ\">I turned to Twitter to ask candidates</a> what they think and how they feel about job listings that don’t mention compensation in clear, honest figures. I made sure I never expressed my opinion on the thread. (Spoiler alert: I think it’s wrong, in the unlikely case this wasn’t clear yet.)</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/J0qiGMP-mNBcFxO4BdC5L_C0563nYEdr8nWiuvQET0lrUudLawjABYdJ8KvPVUrSItGhBfClWK9KfpPQ_a6DRSxPqT9hPQeTMMCRm1ZRENWSYusf4GCGglDKusrKZdaJXJW7HMWiK4uNrIctzK_xwbKnlJty0pO3JRnVbmZqXxWLqSSN1pQ1_Wxf4A\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia/status/1556637508112465922?s=20&t=vx_try6voSZShycZB2-BRQ\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whopping 86.7% out of 135 people said that it’s wrong. I asked those who answered “Wrong but understandable” to explain themselves in the comments, but nobody did. As for the 4th option, it was just silly to include it but I had no characters left in the tweet and as you know, you can’t edit a tweet…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The comments in that thread confirmed my thoughts, but my reach on Twitter is limited as I’m a lurker who hardly ever posts. So I know that there’s much more to the issue than what the thread highlighted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-why-candidates-really-hate-this-practice\">Why candidates <strong>really</strong> hate this practice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be honest and cut to the chase here. The main reason why anyone looks for a job is that we need money in order to survive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, if I didn’t need money I would probably decide to do other useful and meaningful things with my time, but I doubt I’d be giving a third of my life to an employer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some companies love it when you gush and wax lyrical about how the only and overwhelming reason you’re seeking the honor of being part of their team is your admiration for the company which is so high, that you could not possibly put a monetary value on working there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, borrowing Post Status Editor Dan Knauss’ words: “I consider job application questions soliciting praise for the employer to be forms of another question: &#8216;How much will you abase yourself for us?\'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is there\'s only one thing we want to know so we can answer questions like these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How much you are going to pay me in exchange for my time, experience, and skills?</li><li>Are you worth me giving up my freedom?&nbsp;</li><li>Are you worth me connecting my name with your brand?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I want fair compensation for my level of experience. I also want to make sure that you appreciate the depth and range of my skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first thing that tells me whether a position does the above for me is the salary range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When no salary range is mentioned, a red flag immediately starts waving furiously on my mental horizon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are you not telling me what your budget is for this position?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because let’s face it: you definitely <strong>do </strong>have a budget. Everybody does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I just wrote a whole list of answers to the above question in this very article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I’m sorry employers, I know that you mean well and this is not personal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, not one single one of the reasons you gave me for your lack of pay transparency begins to persuade me. I don’t feel like any of them is a good enough reason –&nbsp;or better said, it may be good, but only for you. In fact, some of the reasons you provide are actually causing harm to the workforce at large.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sure that most of you are in good faith. I accept that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in actual fact, the lack of pay transparency has ramifications that extend way further than simply not naming a salary range. Those ramifications are just as damaging and end up hurting –&nbsp;as usual – those minorities that some of your ads proclaim you support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the three practices that stem from and go alongside a lack of pay transparency. They are solely to the (apparent) advantage of the recruiter, and to the detriment of the candidate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The cruel mother of them all: Lack of pay transparency.</li><li>With the first wicked child: Pay range varying based on geographical location.</li><li>And the most evil of offsprings: Requesting candidates to name their desired salary.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that all three of these practices are ethically wrong and that they benefit no one – not even the recruiter employing them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By adopting these hiring practices, you create a company culture that probably limits the pool of talent you can draw from, that likely excludes historically marginalized minorities, and that might even create captive workers – instead of happy ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think I’m exaggerating, but I do think I have a point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me also clarify that I don’t want a confrontation here. It is not my aim to shame or accuse anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather, my aim is to prove that it would be first and foremost <strong>in an employer’s best interest</strong> to let candidates know how much you’re willing to pay them for their skills, their talents, their personality, for giving you over a third of their lives and for representing your company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of the many employers in the WordPress microcosm that chooses to not post a salary range, I would love to persuade you that it’s better for you if you are honest and transparent, and if you don’t discriminate on the basis of geography.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please let me first show you the damaging consequences that your adverts trigger when they don’t list a range, and/or ask candidates to name their price, and/or base the compensation on geographical location.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-1-immediate-irritation\">#1 Immediate irritation.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily take for granted that when you do not post a salary range, you will at least irritate roughly 86.7% of your potential candidates. This percentage is based on the extremely small sample of my Twitter poll (135 people) but I actually think it’s a conservative figure. I can’t fathom anyone who wouldn’t be irritated by a job listing that refuses to disclose compensation. Trust me: nobody likes it. Even when they do end up applying because they need to pay the bills (see #3 below).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-2-loss-of-potential-talent\">#2 Loss of potential talent.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A few of these potentially perfect candidates that you just managed to irritate will not apply, because they have been burnt before. They don’t trust a company that doesn’t post a salary range, and they have good reasons for that. They have been strung along before over the course of many interviews only to find out in the end that the salary on offer was way below the market rate for their valuable skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VuC7kz3CL0Egp0X8uh8SHFBRTXTptv5BWLGj2wGHlHXBSmSo8LK6-8x4c4Dc_sO2l6xdzVktNutm1DbUmAPHvcu0Kzdc_dRwCpew-oWRHc0bKqv9x3vTE85ooeQLVMm6HTiF2Hz1fjiSui8OD0HTm3ZSujHFCnCltKWQYcOAMudH8dEoTOKEmE9P5g\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As for those of you that say you do disclose the salary range to those who ask directly: in that case, why don’t you post it in the advert?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can only think of two reasons for this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You don’t wish current employees to know how much you’re valuing new recruits.</li><li>You offer different compensation depending on a candidate’s location.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there another reason? Genuine question. I’m open to my mind being changed, but I can’t think of another reason besides the two above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-3-the-desperate-will-still-apply\">#3 The desperate will still apply.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people, as you well know, will still apply, because they desperately need a job.

They just don’t have a choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-4-people-will-think-you-re-a-cheapskate\">#4 People will think you’re a cheapskate.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your reasons, when you don’t post a salary range candidates usually assume that you’re tight-fisted and want to shortchange them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0SZcpSZIoJYjfaiXWlk6IyI6SbthEjYO7X-UJ99AD-Oc9vTF5bqjuLtWlXZfBU2woeYg6svZtaUl8NT9mEZTrbRh-vMDSMShh3n0-wihI453GSfhh0NnuWJzU5iojLobgdz7_gFbv2PixXj52pZzDuTGhUadoP9YtbHIHNOCAz1_0gF-gxlpEW9Lyg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r0bZ5dj4mx5kLPdVD7RkiVIq1YaU_3clyVyEC6c0MAHcxxFd-xywIdePzHKOd_0KM7vokjmEKZM6rsSu6W0c3bc_rhRNpMb1rFE0MKzEANnQu3w0rCKgl-9gkWwC18jDshRbNNfjshWl1LRCJXHvBsCir9BOJszZgyVZwUfZK4ARA6bVcgTPQMdaOw\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If that’s not true and you feel unjustly accused, here’s a simple solution:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publish your salary range!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-5-they-will-also-think-that-there-is-no-pay-transparency-culture-in-the-company-at-large\">#5 They will also think that there is no pay transparency culture in the company at large.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are much darker consequences when a company is not transparent about salaries. It’s a practice that traditionally excludes and undermines minorities, perpetuating the gender pay gap and unfair compensation practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/simple-truth/\">Like it or not, the gender pay gap is a reality worldwide</a>, and not disclosing salaries is a way to make sure we’ll never fill that gap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let alone when those people who identify as women are also of color, and living in “developing countries.” (On that, more later.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you claim you value diversity and champion minorities, but you don’t post a salary range, you are actively undermining those minorities you claim to support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that you probably don’t mean to do that, but it’s a well-known side-effect of lack of pay transparency. If you need more convincing, please <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/factsheet-pay_transparency-2019.pdf\">have a look at this fact sheet on pay transparency from the European Commission</a>, which has <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)698934\">a legislation process in progress that will enforce pay transparency</a>, specifically targeting it as the main culprit in pay discrimination issues</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, there must be a reason why at least <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/states-and-cities-where-employers-must-share-salary-ranges-when-hiring.html\">10 US states have made it a legal obligation to disclose pay ranges</a>.

They’ll fear that you are not sure what level of seniority you need for the position, and you expect the candidates to figure that out for you. It’s an internal problem, not a pay range problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I speak from personal experience: it has happened to me at least twice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this seem fair to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it seem efficient?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the time to deeply understand who your company needs –&nbsp;it’s UX work, by the way – and you will be able to better gauge the salary range for the position – with some flexibility, of course, everybody expects that and we’re fine with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, when it comes to range, we are perfectly happy to see a range as wide as 75k to 275k. (I heard this in an actual, real-life call by someone who is advertising for a top role in their company.) And no, we don’t all shoot for the top.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to mention a range like this, it would be an intriguing topic to discuss during that first interview, and I would definitely apply for the job.

Out of all the reasons given for not listing a salary range, this is possibly the least fair – unsurprisingly, it usually goes hand in hand with geographical discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a designer. I am not an expert at negotiating. I hate<strong> </strong>negotiating. I even hate haggling at the market in countries where it’s the norm. Shock horror, I like paying the sticker price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this —&nbsp;or perhaps because of it —&nbsp;I have listened to and read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805\">Chris Voss’s Never Split the Difference</a> at least 5 times, because I do think that negotiation is a life skill we should all have. I am told that as a result, I have become a better negotiator —&nbsp;much to my surprise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am in my 50s, and I have had time to do this in my long life. Younger people may not. We\'ve all heard about <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/fight-impostor-syndrome/\">imposter syndrome</a>.  Many people have it or are extremely uncomfortable when talking about money because they come from disadvantaged, even abusive backgrounds and/or have an &#8220;invisible disability&#8221; like depression. They were led to feel shame about their financial situation from an early age. They sometimes can’t believe they now have skills people are willing to shell out good money for, and they’d rather someone else told them what they’re worth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell: please don’t expect candidates to be confident talking about money and to have serious negotiation skills, let alone when their livelihood depends on it. You may be making them feel really uncomfortable when they are already in a vulnerable position — which is where we are when we look for a job: we feel vulnerable and exposed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, the candidates, are also not HR experts and we don’t always know how much the position you’re advertising is worth in the current market. Plus, the value of a job varies hugely depending on your type and level of clients, the tasks required, whether you’re fully remote or not, whether you’ll require me to travel, any possible extra time to be expected, and the company culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s for you to know: not the candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because my job is to be a designer and an accessible design advocate. I’m not pitching to be your HR department or your finance director, and I’m most certainly not applying to be an FBI negotiator.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you cannot ask me to name my price. I know I would give you the wrong answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same as with the client’s hidden budget, it’s a surefire recipe to shoot myself in the foot – whether I go too far up, or too far down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, I will also&nbsp; tell you&nbsp; who are the categories who will <strong>inevitably </strong>go way too far down when asked to name their own value – because of a myriad of factors starting from inborn low self-esteem, passing through desperately needing to support their family, and ending with the desire to please:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People who identify as women</li><li>People who identify as women of color</li><li>People of color of any gender</li><li>People who are nationals of “developing countries”</li><li>People with disabilities or who identify as disabled</li><li>LGBTQ+ people</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This list can be expanded easily: all you need is empathy and open eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your advert claims that your company champions diversity, but you don’t list a salary range, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/salary-transparency-gender-pay-gap/\">you may not realize that you are probably undermining, excluding, and discriminating against those already marginalized people</a> who would bring their crucial perspective to your workforce and your projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>Editor\'s note: Cory and Michelle have discussed <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/michelle-frechette-on-diversity-and-inclusion-of-underrepresented-groups-in-tech/\">imposter syndrome in the context of diversity and inclusion of underrepresented groups in tech</a>. I recently wrote <a href=\"https://cmt.blog/2022/08/14/disease-depression-and-family-denial/\">a somewhat personal account</a> of the impact of disability, abuse, and neglect early in life or really at any point. Ruchika Tulshyan and Jodi-Ann Burey have <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome\">helpfully pointed out</a> that &#8220;The answer to overcoming imposter syndrome is not to fix individuals, but to create an environment that fosters a number of different leadership styles and where diversity of racial, ethnic, and gender identities is viewed as just as professional as the current model.&#8221;</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-11-pay-range-based-on-geographical-location-is-not-fair\">#11 Pay range based on geographical location is not fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that everyone does it. Automattic does it, Google does it, Slack does it, Meta does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benefitnews.com/news/location-based-salary-does-not-promise-equal-pay\">It still doesn’t make it fair</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, pay based on geographical location is one of the reasons listed for not publishing a salary range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not a good reason, because you could still publish the different ranges you apply to the different areas. Why don’t you do that? Does it mean that you are ashamed of the difference in compensation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salary is most definitely not a “personalized requirement.” There is no way for you to know whether someone who is 40 years old and single in Porto needs less money than someone of the same age who is in New York and has a family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the same token, you should be asking candidates about their personal circumstances and tailoring their compensation according to their answers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you going to lower their salary if they disclose that they have private money?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, will you make it higher should they confess that they are crippled by debt? Would these even be legal questions to ask?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The person in Porto could be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helping out with family debt</li><li>Supporting ailing parents</li><li>Supporting an out-of-work sibling</li><li>Living with an illness that requires extra expenses</li><li>Dealing with personal issues of any kind</li><li>None of our business!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You are paying for skills, talent, and experience. You are paying for the value the employee will bring to your company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the same everywhere. Regardless of geographical location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This raises another genuine question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about digital nomads?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The person who is in New York may decide to move to Porto for a few months. Are you going to adjust their salary accordingly for the duration of their stay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, they may want to work from Mexico for a while, because why not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you going to apply the “Mexico rate” to their monthly cheque?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they’ll go to Thailand, probably even cheaper than Mexico. Will their monthly salary keep going down?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a pattern is emerging, and it’s one that shows that compensation on the basis of location gets dangerously close to being in fact on the basis of ethnicity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I accept that there may not be any evil intention and this may be an unconscious bias, but it might well be what you’re ending up doing – without meaning to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, for legal reasons you might not be able to give your employee in a “cheaper” country the same benefits that the ones in your own country enjoy. Usually, they have to be external contractors, even when they’re on a “permanent” contract, so they’re already losing out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important point to make is that those “adjusted” salaries hardly ever reflect the lived situation on the ground. No matter how painstakingly they adhere to official numbers and stats such as the cost of living index, and so on. The compensation adjusted according to geography usually does not have the same buying power as the “real” salary, the one based on more expensive locations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://careers.ibm.com/job/14243721/devops-engineer-remote/?codes=IBM_CareerWebSite\">IBM is offering a DevOps engineer role in Slovakia</a> for a gross salary of €2,300 a month. No range, that’s the only figure they mention. That’s around $27,000 (USD) a year considering that the euro and dollar are nearly equal in value right now. <a href=\"https://careers.ibm.com/job/15276215/devops-engineer-remote/?codes=IBM_CareerWebSite\">A similar role for the same company in Colorado, with exactly the same job title</a>, offers a pay range between $75,000 and $145,000 a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life in Colorado is not 3 to 6 times more expensive than in Slovakia. You don’t go very far on €27k a year gross in Slovakia, considering that rental prices for a 2-bed apartment in the capital, Bratislava, vary between 600 and 1000 euros. And that’s without utilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, life is way more expensive than you think in Slovakia/Thailand/India/Mexico/insert “cheaper” country here. Please consider that you might be doing your highly skilled workforce an injustice when you shortchange them and stunt their lifestyle and development, for the benefit of their peers living in the “first” world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can personally comment on the issues raised by pay based on geographical location because I am a living demonstration of the fallacy of the system. I lived in London for a couple of decades, and then I moved to Valencia in 2016. For a variety of reasons, from the tax burden on sole traders to the lack of suitable office space, I am finding Valencia quite expensive as a solopreneur. Believe it or not, running my freelance business was WAY cheaper in London. Seriously. I can provide details to those interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, unless your company offers truly amazing other perks (I know that Automattic probably falls into this category and most of their employees never want to leave), you’re running the risk of seeing them&nbsp;leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, however, at least one argument in favor of a higher salary for staff living in ridiculously expensive locations such as New York, London, LA, Singapore, Hong Kong, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s a “location boost,” in case the employer actually needs the employee to live in that location, in order to take meetings, see clients, attend conferences, network, and so on. In that case, it is absolutely fair, and I would add necessary, to compensate the employee for the extra cost that living in an expensive metropolis entails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-if-there-was-a-better-way-that-still-lets-you-be-a-vip-wordpress-agency\">What if there was a better way – that still lets you be a VIP WordPress agency?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of this research, I also came across a number of companies that make a point of always listing salary ranges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of them have built their company ethos around their hiring practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are highly successful companies, so it seems to me that listing a salary range can’t be that damaging after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they do even more. They believe that the way they treat their prospective employees at the beginning is how they will treat them later. They know that their own brand will be shaped by the way candidates feel about them. And they already realize that not telling candidates how much they’re willing to compensate them creates a power imbalance that hurts historically disadvantaged groups the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what they do:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They always post a salary range.</li><li>They offer the same compensation everywhere. It’s about the value you bring to the company, which has nothing to do with your location.</li><li>They don’t demand that you provide a CV to apply.</li><li>They don’t require you to have an up-to-date portfolio.</li><li>They don’t want you to write a cover letter.</li><li>They don’t need you to have a college degree.</li><li>They pay you when you’re asked to do a trial.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lance Robbins from <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> told me:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“XWP always gives a range and I always advocate for this. Providing ongoing feedback throughout the evaluation process helps everyone have realistic expectations of where on that scale a candidate will land. There are some opportunities for negotiation, even within a defined range, so it\'s not completely eliminated, but the likelihood of someone being undervalued and &#8220;low-balled&#8221; is inherently reduced.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It saves everyone a lot of time and stress going into an emotionally charged experience.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>XWP, as you might already know, is an extremely successful VIP agency that has experienced extraordinary growth during the past couple of years, which led to staff numbers growing by about 400% over a short period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XWP managed to successfully hire literally hundreds of people, with a balanced process that did not require the candidate to spend weeks preparing themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there’s another thing that happens when you go the traditional way and you require a CV, a cover letter, and an up-to-date portfolio: many people will be automatically excluded from applying, from the very start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a single mother in charge of young children and you already have a job, you may not have time to update your CV and portfolio, let alone write a cover letter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you suffer from anxiety, imposter syndrome, and depression, having to revisit your entire working history and put it down on screen again may feel like an insurmountable task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you come from an underprivileged background and did not go to university, you may not have been taught how to write an effective CV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of the impediments above mean that you would not be a perfect fit for the role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Brett Snyder, founder, and CEO of the WordPress agency <a href=\"https://www.knucklepuckmedia.com/careers/\">Knucklepuck</a> says:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We have no roles at Knucklepuck that require a college degree.</p><p>We are privileged to work in an industry that requires no formal education and we feel compelled to use our position as a growing company to provide opportunities for under-represented groups.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are truly committed to a diverse workforce, this is the type of attitude that you should embrace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at Knucklepuck they go even further –&nbsp;with their “no resumes allowed” rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, that’s right. Not only are you not required to provide a resume when applying for a job at Knucklepuck: you’re actually not allowed to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brett pointed out to me that the art of writing an effective resume is one that’s usually taught at institutions of higher education that might be very expensive to attend. As a result, those who already had an easier start to their working life are handed out another unfair advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also remarked that reading resumes is a time-consuming process even for the employers themselves: it might take the candidate weeks of toil to perfect a resume which is then only skimmed through by the employer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an inefficient, outdated, and unfair process that ends up benefitting no one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I completely agree, also because even when your CV is up to date, you have to tailor it again for different positions, to highlight the part of your experience that’s more relevant to the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same thing applies to portfolios, and it’s easily circumvented by asking candidates to present 2 or 3 projects that they believe are significant relative to the role. This is what XWP do, too, and I highly commend them for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not skip that step then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has done a fair bit of hiring in her life –&nbsp;let me wear my design department director hat right now, instead of the candidate’s one – I can assure you that most people lie on their CVs, or at least they embellish the truth in order to impress the recruiter. We’ve all done it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am absolutely sure that you can hire the right fit of talent without a CV or a portfolio – and without having to hand in a silly, out-of-context task project that proves zero about their ability to perform in their role at best, exposing them to their ideas being stolen at worst (yes, that definitely happens).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, because I’ve had to fire people that had been hired before my time. They had presented a great CV as well as the required task. They were completely wrong for the role anyway. Firing someone is not pleasant, I can assure you, and it’s a huge waste of time and resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their successors in the role, in case you’re wondering, brought their best projects instead of a portfolio, didn’t need to do a task, and lasted in their positions respectively 8 and 12 years, in both cases leaving of their own volition, after having provided huge value to the institution they designed for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-you-ready-for-big-changes\">Are you ready for big changes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you feel right now? If you are one of those who avoid posting ranges for whatever reason – have I upset you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes being told that what they’re doing is wrong, so you might well take to Twitter now and @ me with all your indignation (my handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia\">@Piccia</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png\" alt=\"😎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As said above – I come in peace.

He made it possible to share media using the Activity Block editor when the BP Attachments plugin is active. The BP Attachments Admin UI has been updated to include an &#8220;Edit Item&#8221; view. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />BP Media Library &#8220;Edit Item&#8221; view\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to updates related to the upcoming release, contributors addressed the important topic of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\">BuddyPress</a>&#8216; declining usage over the past five years. WordPress.org reports active installations at 100,000+, whereas last month they were at 200,000+. The directory rounds that number so it&#8217;s not always representative of the number of people using the plugin. After digging further into the numbers, contributors found that installs are hovering at just under 200,000, but growth is steadily declining and contributors are dwindling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The trend is really not great,&#8221; Viet said. &#8220;We are slowly losing users and the red line is even more concerning. We&#8217;re doing worse compared to last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My analysis is: we&#8217;re not getting enough new users to compensate for users loss.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress&#8217; growth and usage seemed to have peaked around 2016/2017. Participants in the dev chat speculated on the reasons for the decline, which Viet summarized in a writeup of the meeting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>lack of cool front-end things added to the plugin recently</li>\n\n\n\n<li>hesitancy to install a big plugin like BuddyPress for a single feature</li>\n\n\n\n<li>lack of privacy tools, of a media component</li>\n\n\n\n<li>growth of the use of things like Teams and Slack</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BuddyBoss’ commercial aggression (eg: Google Adwords) or their slick-looking theme </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyBoss forked BuddyPress years ago and has set itself up as a competitor to BuddyPress, maligning the open source project in its <a href=\"https://www.buddyboss.com/compare/buddyboss-vs-buddypress/\">video introduction</a>, while still making the platform compatible with all BuddyPress extensions. The video insinuates that BuddyPress is no longer maintained, which has caused confusion for users who have asked on the BuddyPress forums if it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/support/topic/buddypress-org-shutting-down/\">shutting down</a>. BuddyBoss benefits from the ecosystem of extensions that have grown around BuddyPress but is no longer invested in improving the core software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I also think that the work-from-home changes of the 2020s really grew the use of things like Teams and Slack, and some organizations were using BP for that, too,&#8221; BuddyPress contributing developer David Cavins said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a first step towards trying to address the lack of privacy tools, contributors are exploring <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8734\">introducing a &#8220;Private Site&#8221; toggle</a> that would require users to be logged in to visit any BuddyPress components. There is some pushback on this idea, as there are already plugins that enable these types of communities and some view it as adding bloat to BuddyPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are clearly observing a huge decrease on active installs stats,&#8221; Viet <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8734#comment:6\">said</a>. &#8220;This basic feature might not be the thing to inverse the trend, but it would at least show a basic private community can be easily built for users who only need a logged in user only community area.

I haven\'t been on any project involving WordPress, but obviously, with my background, that shouldn\'t be an issue even for intensive projects. How would you recommend I approach getting in touch with WP clients in order to show them I can absolutely take on your project?

I have done that in the past with devs who didn’t know WP. With mixed results, but it pays off when you get lucky. So he should just be open about not having WP dev experience, but being interested in acquiring it and maybe coming up with a strategy on how he will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kim Coleman</strong> from <a href=\"http://paidmembershipspro.com\">Paid Memberships Pro</a>: It sounds like this person is looking for direct client work (freelancing) vs to be hired by an agency (contractor)? If this were me I would write up some packages with a WP focus, such as an e-commerce site setup or migration to WP from another site\'s backend/custom backend. Being a &#8216;senior WP developer’ is great to get hired, but I imagine the customer wants to know if you can just do the exact thing they need (e.g. configure a portal for a virtual event or build a company intranet or handle technical aspects of launching my membership site or course). Clients probably won\'t vet your WP experience as deeply as an agency and are more likely looking for keywords that you &#8220;get it&#8221; for what THEY need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 02:33:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Post Status: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at WordCamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=122000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-at-wordcamps/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1837:\"<p>Will DEI become a formal role for WordCamp organizers?

After the success of the 6.0 walkthrough, this gathering on Zoom has become a new part of the release cycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event took place on Tuesday and the recording was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/14/6-1-product-walk-through-recap/\">published</a> today. If you haven&#8217;t stayed up to date on 6.1 development, this short video (embedded below) gives you a transparent tour of features in their current state and shows some things that still need to be polished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura starts off with a hands-on demo of Twenty Twenty-Three (TT3) and its style variations. He also dived into the new templates and the ability to create custom templates:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this because it opens up the power of WordPress to any user now. If you want to, you have a special category of travel, and you want to create a template for that category, you can do it. And there’s another improvement here. Before, when you were creating a template, it will start completely blank. Now it loads the most relevant template for this. In this case, it was the Archive. So it’s using – you are modifying the tag template, but it’s using the Archive type as its basis. So you don’t need to start from scratch. Obviously, here, in the future, will probably have different starting points, the same way that we have Patterns when you create a new page and so on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He also covered more advanced locking features, the ability to create locked patterns where only a few tools are exposed, improved placeholders, design tools like fluid typography and spacing presets, developer focused tools, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6.1 release squad joined after the walkthrough and covered some other core features, known bugs, and features that are still in limbo. They fielded a few questions from the virtual audience before concluding.

These blocks have been available in the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks plugin</a> since version 2.6 was released in May 2020. They enable store owners to better customize the purchase flow experience with the power of blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two years of testing, the Cart and Checkout blocks are <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/cart-checkout-blocks-support-status/\">compatible</a> with more than a dozen payment gateways and shipping options, as well as 19 popular extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce 6.9 improves filtering products by updating the URL (without reloading the page) when visitors use filters with the All Products blocks. Dropdown attribute filters now allow for users to select multiple terms when the query type is set to <code>AND</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the core team warned last month, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-to-stop-registering-customizer-options-in-upcoming-6-9-release\">WooCommerce will no longer register Customizer options when a block theme is active</a> as of version 6.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few highlights from the 6.9 release, which includes 90 fixes, additions, updates, enhancements, tweaks, and more, from 39 contributors. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/release/6.9/changelog.txt\">6.9 changelog</a> for all the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce development team also published a <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/09/14/high-performance-order-storage-progress-report/\">progress report</a> on the High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS) project, more commonly known as custom order tables. This long-awaited improvement promises significant performance gains for stores. It is a major change that will impact extension developers in different ways. In May, WooCommerce core developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-calls-for-early-testing-on-custom-order-table-migrations\">called for early testing on custom order table migrations</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’ve decided to rename Custom Order Tables to <em>High-Performance Order Storage</em> to make it more clear and more understandable what this change is about and what it should bring everyone,&#8221; WooCommerce core team lead Peter Fabian  said. &#8220;We want our users to understand the why of our work more easily. We also understand that the original name has been around for a long time and some people might still prefer it over the new one, and that is, of course, fine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce has been testing HPOS extensively and has started upgrading Woo-owned extensions. The team plans to present a feature complete version in WooCommerce 7.1, which is expected in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This timeline depends on the number of defects we discover during the testing phase,&#8221; Fabian said. &#8220;Also note that this means the core implementation is production ready, not necessarily that every extension or plugin a site may use is compatible yet.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When HPOS makes its debut in WooCommerce core, it will be strictly opt-in as the rest of the extension ecosystem works to make their plugins compatible. As greater numbers of WooCommerce products adopt HPOS, core will be able to turn it on by default.

Hello, Marcel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Marcel Schmitz: Hello. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s very nice to have you here. First of all, let&#8217;s get a few introductions out the way. Tell us a little bit about WordCamp Europe and why you are here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] Marcel Schmitz: So, WordCamp Europe is very special to me because I&#8217;ve been living in Porto for 35 years. I was, born in Brazil I have German citizenship and yeah, my parents came here in 1988, so I&#8217;m here the whole time and I&#8217;m not gonna change this city for any other. I&#8217;m very much in love with the city. So obviously WordCamp Europe is very special for me, especially because I&#8217;m getting all my friends, WordPress friends, together in the city that I know very well, show them around. So yeah, it&#8217;s super special occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s just the nicest of spots isn&#8217;t it? Yeah. So really kind of unusual for you in that you basically can go home to your own bed in the evening,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:56] Marcel Schmitz: Right. That&#8217;s very unusual. That&#8217;s also at the same time, very practical, I guess I have the flexibility to just jump home very quickly, grab my things and just go with it. Nonetheless, for the last two days I&#8217;ve been at a hotel. It&#8217;s easier with the logistic at home, with my wife, my kid going to school because they&#8217;re still in school by this time of year. So for me not to interfere with their normal schedule, I&#8217;m just staying in a hotel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s really ingenious. Your reason for being here is what? As far as I know, you&#8217;re not got a speaking engagement. You&#8217;re here as a, as an attendee?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:31] Marcel Schmitz: Correct, yeah. That&#8217;s correct. This time, and every WordCamp Europe, we have also Codeable experts here. Which are people who I work with every day. And we have also people from Codeable staff here. So one of the main reasons to attend this is obviously to meet all these people. There are a lot of experts that we didn&#8217;t get to meet in person for a long time. It has been a couple of years. It&#8217;s one of the reasons is that obviously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second reason I would say there&#8217;s a lot of good talks that I would like to keep up. There&#8217;s new things that came out. There&#8217;s also other people from other teams, from Automattic, from WooCommerce etcetera, that I would like very much to meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s basically it. It&#8217;s such a good opportunity to be in person with everyone, and to be together after all these years. It just makes it a wonderful time everyone being together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:15] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just try to paint a picture of your work life? In that you, I&#8217;m guessing that your large amount of your income comes from Codeable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:23] Marcel Schmitz: Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] Nathan Wrigley: So, not necessarily dwelling on the Codeable piece itself yet, but just tell us what is it that you do? How does your work flow towards you? Are you basically taking on work that Codeable put in your inbox, if you like, and you can accept and decline things? And have you found that way of living to be enjoyable or is it stressful? Do you have to generate a lot of your own work or does it just land in your lap?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] Marcel Schmitz: Right. So we have a very special place in our platform where everybody who&#8217;s an expert, who got access and who got admitted to the platform has a list of opportunities. And those are clients who come in. They register their projects. They have a project description. They ask for a specific area of expertise, and we just browse those projects. And we just get to choose whatever wanna work with. Basically what starts then is a conversation between us, the experts and the client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So multiple experts can come in and also ask questions and present themselves. And yeah, after a couple of messages we exchange, we talked about the project, we scope it out. And that basically then the clients decides if you want to hire us or not. Basically, I look for the job that I want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read what the client needs to do. If it fits my area of expertise, I&#8217;m gonna interact with the client. That is an awesome way to do it for me, because you get to pick how much you wanna work. If you will have a planned a couple of days off, you can do that. You can also talk with a client, this is gonna take four weeks, five weeks, six weeks, whatever time it will take to complete the project. And you can add a little bit buffer to that so you can manage anything in between. So it&#8217;s absolutely not stressful, is actually something that gives you the most control possible as a freelancer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:03] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s just sort of dig a little bit deeper into that then. So you&#8217;re looking at your inbox for things to drop into it, where you, you are given an opportunity and you can peruse it and decide if it&#8217;s for you or not. And then how does it go from there? You say, actually this piece of work I&#8217;m interested in, and then you just hand it back to Codeable and they say, okay, we&#8217;ll communicate. And how is it confirmed that Marcel ,you&#8217;ve got the job and not somebody else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:23] Marcel Schmitz: Right. So all the communications are done by the experts themselves. So Codeable does not interfere with the conversation between the expert and the client. If we find that the task is interesting to us, we just start typing in what we call the workroom and that project that is there is gonna be then the place where the conversation happens between the client and the expert themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it is then up to the client to decide if he wants to work with that specific expert. The client has access to a profile and on the profile, the experts say what they&#8217;re good at, what their area of expertise, their work portfolio, everything that it worked before. And they can also read reviews that other previous clients have left for that specific expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:02] Nathan Wrigley: How do you get the bonafides to be an expert? In other words, if I was to hire you and you&#8217;ve got on your portfolio, that I dunno you maybe a React expert or something like that. Where does the trust come from? Apart from the reviews, I can see that you&#8217;ve done this piece of work, and you&#8217;ve obviously got an amazing litany of reviews and everything that you&#8217;ve done everybody&#8217;s happy with. But when you launch into the platform, presumably there must be some kind of vetting process where you&#8217;ve got to prove that you can actually do what you claim you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:27] Marcel Schmitz: Right. So, the vetting process is multi-phase process that goes from interviews to coding to a time where you do some trial and you have to present some code. You are also given a small task. You have to communicate with a client. So then from the Codeable side, there are people who are gonna look at that who are gonna evaluate if that&#8217;s at their standard, what they&#8217;re requiring. And that&#8217;s not only in the coding part on the technical part that you have to be an expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on the soft skills, like talking to the client, being polite, being able to explain what is happening or what is he&#8217;s going to do. So for an expert that comes in and has zero in their project count, zero in their client count, it will very much rely on what he writes as his presentation on his portfolio. Obviously these are people who are, are not starting as the developers right now, right? So they&#8217;ve previously worked either with other agencies or they have been freelancers themselves. So, they already have some expertise and some experience in different areas, that they&#8217;re gonna present in their profiles, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after the first project and the second and the third coming in, those numbers are gonna be coming up. Reviews are gonna come up. But I guess the most important part, I&#8217;m pretty sure this is what happens with most of the experts, is that the conversation that we have with the client at that moment for that project is the most important tool that you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is what the client is gonna rely the most. If he understands that you know what you&#8217;re talking about, or if he feels comfortable that your solutions that you&#8217;re providing your, they have a problem and you have a solution and you explain it very clearly, and the client feels comfortable with your replies. That&#8217;s exactly what the client is gonna be inclined to work with you. And then later, perhaps gonna look at the profile and see what you&#8217;ve done in the past. But I think if you really show in that conversation that you know how to solve that problem, he&#8217;s gonna be very comfortable hiring you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: If you work for an agency or something like that, there&#8217;s a career path, isn&#8217;t there? There&#8217;s a trajectory. You start on the, the lower rung of the ladder. And as time goes on, you move up towards the top or you may flip to a different agency or something like that. Is there things built into systems like Codeable to enable you to do that? In other words, do you have to reauthenticate yourself as an expert every few years? And can you say actually now I&#8217;d, I&#8217;d also like to add this badge to my portfolio? I&#8217;ve done some work in React and I can claim that I&#8217;m good at that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:46] Marcel Schmitz: Right. You can always do that, right. So you can always update and can you always go there and say, oh, I&#8217;ve worked for the first time on a React project. I&#8217;ve learned React, and it went very well. Now I can go out there and say, I am now have the experience in React, and I&#8217;m gonna propose myself as a React developer. Yes, you can definitely do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also on the platform, you can work as a freelancer by yourself. You don&#8217;t have to be belonging to an agency or you don&#8217;t have to have a company behind it. But if you have, like it is in my case, there is one person, one face, one name, and you indicate that you belong to an agency, and you just name other persons that might interact with your name on the platform so that everybody knows, okay, this is Marcel&#8217;s company, but there might be people talking on behalf of Marcel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will be clearly identified. They will talk with them. So, the adding of the expertise can also come from other agencies, having other experts coming into the agency. But for that to happen also Codeable needs to know that they need to know who are those people. And that&#8217;s basically how we then make sure that everybody knows exactly what they&#8217;re doing, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:50] Nathan Wrigley: If I was to work in an agency and let&#8217;s say I was the agency owner, and I suddenly took on 3,000 staff, this would be the death of my business because I couldn&#8217;t afford payroll. But I&#8217;m just wondering about the piece in there of, is there a limit, do you know if there&#8217;s a limit? In other words, if 6,000 people show up tomorrow with the bonafides to say, I can do React at a really high level, do they all get taken into the platform or is there some kind of system to protect the people who&#8217;ve first through the door if you&#8217;d like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:17] Marcel Schmitz: Right. So I wouldn&#8217;t say 6,000 is acceptable in the platform. It&#8217;s not viable. There is no way somebody would show up in the platform with that many experts, because, I mean for him to get those 6,000, he has to have already the infrastructure to deal with them, right? There are certainly people who have, 15, 20, expertise or people working for the agency. I dunno if there&#8217;s a limit, but I would say 20, 30 is enough. But the funny thing is that there are three more times projects than experts right now at the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a good problem to have, right? It&#8217;s not that easily solvable, it&#8217;s not just adding more experts and experts because the whole issue is you have to be good at communicating. You have to speak English perfect. Well, not perfectly, but at least in a way that people understand you. And you have to be obviously presentable. There are some opportunities and times where you go and have a consultation call that involves a video call. There&#8217;s a lot of other elements to that, that will try to make that client feel comfortable with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people when they get in this platform, because it is not like any other platform out there. They will struggle initially a little bit into getting into the whole way of functioning, right? So it is not an easy onboarding. It&#8217;s not as easy as, here&#8217;s an agency with 300 developers, let&#8217;s put them on the platform and problem solved. Because there&#8217;s still a lot of communication to go, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are clients who don&#8217;t want to just hire another agency for that, and just have one face representing them. They wanna have close contact to whoever is developing their project. They wanna know exactly what&#8217;s going on. They don&#8217;t want to have a chain to go through to know why that specific code didn&#8217;t work, why the test fails or something like that. So it&#8217;s very, very unique to smaller teams, or even like down to this one freelance developer who just gained the trust of this client, and he&#8217;s gonna hire you over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:04] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned that there was three times, at the moment we&#8217;re recording this when WordCamp Europe is on. So maybe the numbers will go up. Maybe they&#8217;ll go down. But, roughly at the moment there&#8217;s three times more people offering work than there are people to fulfill that work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:15] Marcel Schmitz: Correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:17] Nathan Wrigley: A housing market analogy might be it&#8217;s a seller&#8217;s market. So that&#8217;s quite something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:20] Marcel Schmitz: It is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:21] Nathan Wrigley: So you get to turn things down because they&#8217;re not, well, you can cherry pick basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:26] Marcel Schmitz: You can cherry pick. That&#8217;s the whole beauty of it. And it goes back to your question where you asked, if you feel stressful, if you feel, uh, happy or okay. That&#8217;s exactly it. So you get to choose which project you wanna work with. And also the same way that the clients get a read on you as an expert in how we communicate and how you interact with the client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same we get from the client, right. So if the client spends time explaining what he wants. If he puts the documentation out. If he provides you with screenshots. If he has drawn on a piece of paper, anything that he wants to build, that shows that the client has interest and the time to invest in whatever he wants to do, right? So when we go cherry pick is not only about the project that we feel comfortable with. It&#8217;s also in regards to the client. So we&#8217;ll try to figure out if there&#8217;s a good client to have, or to try at least get this project going. And I can say in my portfolio of clients, I&#8217;ve worked with 160 different clients already, and it&#8217;s been 70 percent of the work is repetitive, is returning clients that come back and wants something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That goes to show that it&#8217;s all about communication, about building that trust. And that&#8217;s also one of the reasons why we have this ratio, right? Three more times project and experts because we tend to keep old clients, right. And they&#8217;re gonna obviously post on the platform as well. Obviously immediately be picked up by you and you will work on them. So you have less time to get new clients in, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:47] Nathan Wrigley: Do Codeable help you in, let&#8217;s say you run up against something, a problem. Are you left to your own devices or is there support and help there? And then another sort of slightly related question? Equipment, technology, the computer, the internet connection. Does any of that get rolled into the, the thing that Codeable provide? In other words, once you join the platform, are there certain minimum things that you must have? Certain commitments in terms of I&#8217;m gonna work this many hours a week, you must have a computer of this standard. Just run all of that by us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:13] Marcel Schmitz: Right? Sure. So, there&#8217;s absolutely no minimum technical requirements at all, because by the time you get to the vetting process, you will pass through a process, whether they will eventually know what you&#8217;re doing, right. And a developer that has been doing this for many many years knows exactly what he needs and what he wants. So in the technical aspect, there&#8217;s absolutely no minimal requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to the support that Codeable provides, 100%. New experts that come in, they usually have a hard time picking tasks. Other more, more experienced experts go in faster and communicate in a faster pace than the recently joined ones. And so Codeable sometimes go and help those people pick projects for them, right. And there&#8217;s also like Slack, which is an awesome tool that we use to promote projects that weren&#8217;t picked up because there&#8217;s so many coming in, they were overlooked or there&#8217;s so many people looking for any other types of projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So new experts that come in, they will get support from Codeable, and they have Codeable staff to pick some of the projects for them. Like this first project, good first projects to have for them to start building their client relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:18] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of the way that Codeable keeps itself going, obviously there must be some sort of financial benefit to Codeable providing you with all this stuff. How does that work? Do they suggest a fee or are you in charge of what you are gonna be charging for a particular project or do they set a fee for a certain type of work and, what&#8217;s their cut, and all of that kind of stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] Marcel Schmitz: So, that&#8217;s another very good aspect of belonging to the Codeable community because we get to fix our own price, but there is a range. So the minimum would be $70 an hour and the maximum would be $120 an hour. So it&#8217;s the higher end rate that I would say in the WordPress area. But then again, that means that you have to position yourself within what do you think is your expertise worth. In my case, I&#8217;ve been working with WooCommerce for more than 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a little bit on the upper range. But also, I&#8217;m also very quickly able to tell the person what he needs to do, and how many hours it&#8217;s gonna take for me to do that. So it&#8217;s all on our hands. So we have the scope of the project, and we&#8217;re gonna go there, and this takes eight hour. My rate is such and such. And we put the estimate on the workroom. And on top of that, Codeable then charges the client 17.5 percent, and then it also takes from our ends 10%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we contribute with 10% of our revenue, to the platform for them to keep the work going and to help us get the clients and also to mitigate any conflict that there is. Right. So if there is any disputes of some sorts, Codeable will immediately be the middle part of that. And we&#8217;ll try to get everything together. And the client, the 17.5%, same thing. So if the client doesn&#8217;t find an expert, if nobody replies, if they need some sort of an additional information about how to build a project or how to promote it into the platform, Codeable will also be there to help him out. So that&#8217;s how they build their, their business around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] Nathan Wrigley: We&#8217;ve talked a lot about it from your side, so let&#8217;s just flip it very quickly before we get onto the WooCommerce bit to close it out. From the client perspective, you just mentioned that things go wrong, right? Agencies, freelancers and clients, they&#8217;re not always a match made in heaven. Things do go pear shaped and, you know, disagreements arise. Let&#8217;s talk about that. How do you ensure, how do you basically do quality assurance? What is the disagreement process? And are you, as a member of Codeable, it sounds like you are kind of immune from that discussion. They take that a bit away from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:31] Marcel Schmitz: Well, not immediately. So obviously you are responsible for everything that you do with the, um, project in particular and with the client, all the communication. And sometimes when a client does find that something is missing was not done according to scope or the expert is not responding or is not being clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately the client can contact the support team and the support team will contact the expert and try to get things sorted out, right. Most of the time I would say I never had a dispute where Codeable would needs to apply, there&#8217;s a certain way for them to solve this dispute, right. So there&#8217;s a form that we fill out and everybody explains their part, and they then mitigate this. But until it reaches that point, you have a lot of opportunity to talk to the client. So in my experience at the beginning, I had a couple of clients were more difficult ones and you sort of like learn from that experience, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and sometimes the client also understands that it didn&#8217;t understand before how the platform works, and all the change requests that come after that. How, why should I pay for a change request? This is obviously it should be red instead of green, right. But it&#8217;s not written green, it&#8217;s written red, right. So all these little bits can obviously build up to then not getting into a good relationship. It&#8217;s mainly up to you and yeah, Codeable helps you also mitigate that before they themselves present us. Okay. We are here, we&#8217;re gonna help solve this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:46] Nathan Wrigley: Is your expertise in Codeable then, WooCommerce, is that the thing that you&#8217;ve nailed your flag, you&#8217;ve that to the mast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:51] Marcel Schmitz: Yes. 100%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] Nathan Wrigley: So tell us about your interest in WooCommerce. Why WooCommerce as opposed to just regular WordPress? Is that just an area that you got interested in? Do you love e-commerce? It&#8217;s obviously a bit more of a niche and there&#8217;s actual money to be made from those websites, which is quite interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] Marcel Schmitz: Correct. So my initial interest in WooCommerce goes back to a dream that I once had, that I thought would be my business in the future. That would be have a marketplace online to sell different products and to have, to help local shops around my city to have their products online and sell them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I came first in contact with WooCommerce and the ability that we have to build a store online and don&#8217;t spend no money at all in getting there. It&#8217;s very fascinating. And then all the things that come with it, the scalability and the fact that you can connect it to other mediums. The fact that you can make it so fast that it&#8217;s not comparable to other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everything that goes around WooCommerce is very interesting. But the building of the business, the helping others build their business, and they got fired, now they wanna do something else. They have an idea and you come in and say, hey, this is WooCommerce. This is how you set up subscriptions, or this is how you sell courses and et cetera. It&#8217;s fascinating how people get inspired by the platform and by the tool and how you can help them get there and have a successful business out of that. That is the fascinating part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:10] Nathan Wrigley: This next sentence is based upon no data whatsoever, but I&#8217;m gonna ask it anyway. It feels like the pandemic may have been a good time to be into WooCommerce. Is that true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:23] Marcel Schmitz: Yes, that&#8217;s 100%. I don&#8217;t have any specific data as well, but I&#8217;ve seen my work increase three times during the pandemic. And a lot of them were first time businesses that wanted to go online and they wanted to start a new thing, and this was their opportunity. Many of them come with very little knowledge what is to sell a product, because sell a product is not only put it out there and get the money. It&#8217;s also providing support, pre-sales questions, everything that has to do with a broken product or anything that doesn&#8217;t work on the website. So there&#8217;s a lot of other things around the business and online business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, definitely the pandemic gave a huge opportunity for those experts to increase in our number of clients. But I would say the most important part that I picked up from this time was how people found a new way to get their living and to build a business. And some of them are quite up there right now so, they&#8217;re basically not going back to their previous job and what they were doing before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:19] Nathan Wrigley: So with the analogy of a seesaw, it goes up, it also goes down. During the pandemic, up it goes and are we seeing a decline?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:27] Marcel Schmitz: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:28] Nathan Wrigley: Really, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:29] Marcel Schmitz: Defininitely not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:30] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s, maintaining, it&#8217;s gone up and it stays up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] Marcel Schmitz: It is. And I think one of the reasons behind that is because these people that during the pandemic started doing their businesses, they told others and they are an example for others. And maybe those other who didn&#8217;t quite have a hard time as the previous ones had during the pandemic, they started think, oh, maybe this can be a side business, or maybe I can do something as I do my regular work. And so it&#8217;s constantly increasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:56] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. Again, based upon no data, I would&#8217;ve assumed it to go down. So couple of years ago, came onto my radar that Shopify was just going like the bomb. Everybody was talking about it. It was increasing. Seems like that conversation continues. It seems like it&#8217;s going really well. If I were a developer and I wanted to go for Shopify development or I wanted to go to WooCommerce development, clearly you&#8217;ve gone for Woo. Just paint the picture of why Woo, not a proprietary SaaS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:26] Marcel Schmitz: You can do anything that you want with WooCommerce, anything, right. And Shopify is for a specific type of online business, it&#8217;s not for everyone. And you as a developer are very limited within the Shopify platform. The limitation is to. probably in some type of business, is not bad because it also provides stability of the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certain critical areas of a e-commerce solution that cannot fail. Payment methods cannot fail. The shipping part cannot fail. People have to check out. There is the conversion rate that has to be assured so that the business is successful. And WooCommerce on the other side gives you so much more flexibility in changing things around that we&#8217;ll meet the client&#8217;s expections. But also at the same time, it makes you more responsible for doing everything right, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single developer that works with WordPress and with WooCommerce has seen code that is probably not up to standards, right. There are many different ways to do the same thing. And so with WooCommerce, you have so much flexibility, but if you do it exactly by code, by standard, you&#8217;re gonna get that performance that you need. You&#8217;re gonna get every single bit of customization that a client wants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;ve done a couple of conversions from Shopify to WooCommerce where they say this now finally feels like I can do anything that I want. But you have always obviously to explain, yeah, you can do anything they want, but it comes with a price. You have to be also more responsible. The things that we request, right? Because not everybody understands that changing a checkout page may influence how people check out, or if they even check out at all. So that comes with responsibilities as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:59] Nathan Wrigley: You were talking earlier about the fact that you can cherry pick a little bit. If somebody came into the Codeable platform and said, I just need a basic WooCommerce site, that maybe is something that you are not interested in these days, because you&#8217;ve gone through that a number of times I imagine, and maybe the interest isn&#8217;t there. And when we were setting up this interview, you mentioned all sorts of incredibly ingenious and interesting things that you are doing on the other end. You&#8217;re basically using WooCommerce as a conduit to push data to mobile platforms and all that. Tell us about some of the exciting, cutting edge stuff that you&#8217;ve been involved in recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] Marcel Schmitz: Well, just to go up to your question previously a normal website that comes in, a regular business, small shop. I would not immediately reject it because it&#8217;s small. It&#8217;s exactly on that opportunity that I think it&#8217;s the most fascinating, right? So, because it&#8217;s a green project. It&#8217;s very new. There are so many things that can be done. There is an idea. There is a product. There is a person who&#8217;s gonna invest in that and is gonna put effort into working on that project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities to guide that person into the right direction, right. And if the results come quick, the person will immediately figure out that you&#8217;re a good partner for them to work as the technology goes. As far as more complicated projects, yeah I think one of the most interesting ones is an app that we did for a client that were selling ear rings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you would use your phone camera to emulate how they look on your ears. So you would just point the camera towards your face, and you would choose the earrings that would match you the best. And all of that was done using WooCommerce on the background. The 3d models that were attached to the products within WooCommerce, and they were just using the Rest API to upload them to the app. And basically everything worked natively. So the browsing of the products, looking up the descriptions, doing the augmented reality stuff, that was all based on WooCommerce, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:43] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. That&#8217;s incredible. And probably very interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] Marcel Schmitz: It&#8217;s awesome. And, also at the same time is very challenging. And the challenging part here was get the 3d model right. Because it was so impactful that the color has to be there. The shape has to be there, because you&#8217;re emulating a 3d object in an environment. The shadow has also to be right. The cool part about that was that on iOS, we are so advanced with augmented reality right now, that if I would be in this room and the light would be coming from a direction, the 3d model would understand where the light comes from and it would change the shadow on that 3d object. So it make, looks more natural on yourself. And that was the surprising part of that project. And, and it was really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:25] Nathan Wrigley: Very quickly just to wrap it up, because sadly we&#8217;re running out of time. We have restrictions on the amount of time that we can go. One of the things that you mentioned in the information that you passed to me was headless. Headless WooCommerce, just like I said briefly, tell us what that all means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] Marcel Schmitz: I do think that the headless word carries too much negative connotation, because it has become a trend almost like, hey, I&#8217;m an awesome developer. I can completely detach the front end from the back end. And I&#8217;ve implemented 1000 different packages or libraries or whatever. And this works very fast. Awesome. Right, but what can you do else with it? Can you install plugins and they do show up on the front end? Can you change the checkout page for anything that you would like to have? No, you can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I found fascinating about headless is not everything has to run on the server, right? So if you have a regular WooCommerce store, most of the HTML that you see on the screen is firstly generated on the server and then passed to the browser. As we have more advanced computers, we have browsers are more capable, some of that job can be done on the client side and client side means on the browser, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So headless for me, it&#8217;s super interesting because, there are upcoming technologies who will divide the work that the server does and the work that the client will do. Not everything should be on the client side as well. So there&#8217;s no extreme. There&#8217;s like not 8, not 80. We have to find a 40 in the middle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the challenging part. So with some of the parts, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been experimenting lately, can be done in a headless way. Browsing through a project catalog doesn&#8217;t need server work. It can be everything done in the client work. But then again, the checkout page, it can be completely detached from the server, but should it be? Is that the real solution for the problem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we have a problem in that regard? Because we can also supercharge the server and the checkout page can also be awesomely fast, and we don&#8217;t need to bring all the work to the client side, right? But what&#8217;s fascinating is that we have so much tools right now, the Rest API is at it&#8217;s best right now, and we can do anything with them and we can check out, we can work with a cart. Gutenberg is obviously a tool that you use to make everything work on the front end side. It works faster. It is much more easier for the clients to manage and to build the pages. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be everything on the client&#8217;s side. That&#8217;s where I see the challenge to decide where to put the weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] Nathan Wrigley: Marcel Schmitz, thank you for joining us. Thanks for telling about how you find work and about the interesting work that you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:46] Marcel Schmitz: Thank you very much Thank you.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Contributors Call on Theme Authors to Test Using Block-Based Template Parts in Classic Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137803\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-call-on-theme-authors-to-test-using-block-based-template-parts-in-classic-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3710:\"<p>If you watched <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2022/09/12/a-chat-with-matt-mullenweg-wordcamp-us-2022-qa/\">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s Q&amp;A session</a> at WordCamp US last weekend, it&#8217;s evident that there are significant parts of the community still clinging to the Classic Editor who would be happy for it to be supported indefinitely. For whatever reason, millions users are not ready to switch &#8211; some prefer the old editor, don&#8217;t like blocks, don&#8217;t want to learn a new system, or simply find the newer versions of WordPress too confusing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recognition that some users may need a transitional bridge over to the block editor, with an opportunity to dip their toes into it without breaking their whole site design, Gutenberg 14.1 will introduce the ability for theme authors to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42729\">use block-based template parts in classic and hybrid themes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne McCarthy, who coordinates the FSE outreach program and Gutenberg testing, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/09/12/testing-and-feedback-for-using-block-based-template-parts-in-classic-themes/\">posted</a> to the Make Themes blog, calling on theme authors to test it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gradual adoption options remains a focus for the project and, increasingly, there are more ways to adopt parts rather than the whole of a feature coming to the latest version of WordPress,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;The aim is to allow folks to adopt what they need as they are ready in a way that is still future forward.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors will need to specify block-template-parts theme support and use Gutenberg trunk or Gutenberg 14.1 when it’s released on September 15th, 2022. Then they can add block-based template parts as HTML files placed into the parts directory inside the root of the theme. These can then be output inside the theme&#8217;s PHP templates using the block_template_part function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Users will see a new &#8216;Template Parts&#8217; menu visible under &#8216;Appearance,&#8217; which displays a list of template parts,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;From there, all theme blocks are available, but the environment is inherently limited compared to block themes. For example, users can edit existing template parts but not delete them or create new ones.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy suggested a few use cases for adding block-based template parts to classic themes &#8211; enabling authors to offer a header template part that allows users to set a video or image background, adjust the focal point, move blocks around, or offer a footer with design blocks locked but content that is easy to edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While this feature is currently aimed at providing options for themes, plugins can also explore extending this functionality to enable the same UI for users,&#8221; McCarthy said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes represent just 2.5% of WordPress themes in the directory, so this new capability is applicable to the majority of themes. Motivating classic theme authors to support this in their themes is another challenge if they don&#8217;t see the benefit to users or determine that the different editing experience would be too confusing. It may have an easier entry point through plugins, as users may be more likely to embrace a different editing UI for plugin functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more technical details and code examples for adding theme support, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/09/12/testing-and-feedback-for-using-block-based-template-parts-in-classic-themes/\">post</a> outlining how to test using block-based template parts in classic themes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 03:46:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: National Harbor, Maryland to Host WordCamp US and Community Summit, August 23-25, 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137777\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/national-harbor-maryland-to-host-wordcamp-us-and-community-summit-august-23-25-2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4087:\"<p>WordCamp US 2022 has concluded after two days of presentations and a contributor day last weekend.

He revived the notion of canonical plugins, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/canonical-plugins/\">first introduced to the WordPress community in 2009</a> as a means for delivering optional features to users with a higher level of confidence than regular plugins:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Canonical plugins would be plugins that are community developed (multiple developers, not just one person) and address the most popular functionality requests with superlative execution. These plugins would be GPL and live in the WordPress.org repo, and would be developed in close connection with WordPress core. There would be a very strong relationship between core and these plugins that ensured that a) the plugin code would be secure and the best possible example of coding standards, and b) that new versions of WordPress would be tested against these plugins prior to release to ensure compatibility. There would be a screen within the Plugins section of the WordPress admin to feature these canonical plugins as a kind of Editor’s Choice or Verified guarantee. These plugins would be a true extension of core WordPress in terms of compatibility, security and support.</p>\n<cite>Jen Mylo &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/canonical-plugins/\">Canonical Plugins (Say What?)</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress Plugins Directory</a> is just one plugin away from crossing 60,000 (at the time of publishing). In contrast to the idea of canonical plugins, the official directory is still like the wild west in terms of what users can expect from plugin authors. Mullenweg cited several plugin scenarios that are not ideal for users &#8211; such as a plugin being controlled by a single company and evolving to go more towards a pro version or removing previously free functionality and putting it behind an upgrade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canonical plugins are meant to provide a trustworthy alternative to plugins where authors&#8217; motivations may not put users first. It also provides an avenue for core contributors to demonstrate the demand for features they want to land in WordPress. &nbsp;A few projects like MP6,&nbsp;Gutenberg, and&nbsp;the REST API have taken this path into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are reaching a point where core needs to be more editorial and say &#8216;no&#8217; to features coming in as ad hoc as they sometimes do, and my hope is that more Make teams use this as an opportunity to influence the future of WordPress through a plugin-first approach that gives them the luxury of faster development and release cycles (instead of three times per year), less review overhead, and and path to come into core if the plugin becomes a runaway success,&#8221; Mullenweg said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am very conscious that when people are aiming to have something in core, a &#8216;no&#8217; or &#8216;not now&#8217; can be frustrating and sometimes create artificial pressure to put something in before it’s ready, as I believe happened with the REST API in WP 4.4.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a related <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/webp-in-core-for-6-1/\">post</a> that inspired the renewed discussion on canonical plugins, Mullenweg weighed in on the controversial WebP by default proposal that had recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-on-hold-for-6-1-after-new-objections-from-wordpress-lead-developers\">received new objections</a> from WordPress lead developers. Contributors have been working feverishly to revise their approach in time for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg recommended these new features as a prime candidate for the canonical plugin pathway, suggesting it would give more time for the ecosystem around WebP to mature:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&nbsp;I am interested in supporting new formats and improving performance, but I think this change being pushed by default to users when they upgrade to 6.1 is a lot for right now, including with some of the clunky interactions OSes still have around webp (and HEIC!) files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m happy for support for working for webp and HEIC files to stay in&nbsp;core, as we should be liberal in what we accept and work with, but not with the change to convert everything to webp when JPEGs are uploaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance team <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02KGN5K076/p1662980866303979?thread_ts=1662925534.926459&cid=C02KGN5K076\">plans to discuss</a> this in tomorrow&#8217;s scheduled chat. It&#8217;s not clear yet whether the recent WebP by default efforts will be punted to canonical plugin status or if some part of it may still land in 6.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to the call for more canonical plugins were mixed, as some immediately recognized the increased burden on maintainers of these plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WP just needs to get over it’s aversion to optional features,&#8221; WordPress developer Jon Brown said. &#8220;Features that can be enabled/disabled. &#8216;Decisions not options&#8217; is a great ethos when it’s about keeping things simple for users but it seems to have been thrown out the window with Gutenberg UX, and turned into axiom when discussing adding trivially simply options to the settings page.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iThemes-sponsored contributor Timothy Jacobs said he is not necessarily in support of adding more options to Core but thinks canonical plugins could be presented in a similar way to options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That doesn’t mean the UI has to be just searching through the plugins directory for something you want,&#8221; Jacobs said. &#8220;The canonical plugins could be exposed in maybe a &#8216;settings-like&#8217; UI. I think Import methods are a bit hidden away in the Tools menu, but something like that perhaps.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core contributor Torsten Landsiedel said the difference between canonical plugins and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/features-as-plugins/\">feature plugins</a> is not clear. The distinction may be that canonical plugins include those that may never belong in core but are still important for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It sounds like the &#8216;WordPress importer&#8217; plugin could be a canonical plugin,&#8221; Landsiedel said. &#8220;Not sure if this a good example for a *thriving* plugin. Does not support featured images, struggles with high amounts of posts/media, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The useful Health Check plugin struggles with missing people helping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How do we prevent those plugins (whatever called) from not getting enough contributors? I think an importer is a crucial tool, but also not necessary in core (I can install it if I need it, that’s okay) – but it should work and at the moment this does not work well. But I don’t see much interest from the dev community to help fix this (maybe because they use WP CLI and do not care about this plugin?)&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core contributor Colin Stewart said that while he agrees features as plugins first is useful for new features, it requires &#8220;a much better metric than &#8216;runaway success,&#8217; for inclusion in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some features are important for stability, and protect users from issues that give them a headache multiple times during their website’s lifetime, but aren’t something users might think to search for in the plugin repository, or install on sight,&#8221; Stewart said. &#8220;Rollback is such a feature, as is Site Health, Privacy Export/Erase, and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A formal decision-making process for proposals would be incredibly helpful. This topic is coming up regularly now.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg offered nearly two dozen ideas for canonical plugins the Make teams could consider and suggested the teams themselves could likely come up with better ideas. Imagining all these new features in play, it would be like a renaissance of innovation in the admin. This is an exciting prospect that could benefit WordPress users as long as the plugins are featured in such a way that they are easy to adopt. Early commenters on the idea raise legitimate concerns about the lack of maintainers, as history shows support for some of the existing canonical plugins is somewhat patchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I hope it sparks discussion at contributor day and beyond on how we can utilize plugins better to increase the speed of evolution for WordPress, keep core light, fast, and opinionated, and do so while saying &#8216;yes&#8217; to more ideas and experimentation,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Sep 2022 02:30:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: WCUS Q&amp;A\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=61957\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://ma.tt/2022/09/wcus-qa/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:677:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp United States</a> was in San Diego this year, a really lovely town.

Ny</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> good morning, Dan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> All right. It\'s gonna be a busy, busy week prepping for travel to, um, word camp us. I\'m I\'m sure you\'re running fast and. hopefully getting some, some rest in there too, but how, how are things going</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> on there? I actually am getting rest. I think the holiday helped, but yeah, I\'m definitely running around like a chicken with a Ted cut off and , I\'m hoping I don\'t forget to pack anything, but I\'m very excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to be my first big word camp and my first time in San Diego. So I\'m super excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, me too. Yeah. I. haven\'t been down LA in a while, but yeah, never San Diego and first word camp. Um, yeah, the labor day was nice. It\'s one of those, uh, Canada has every province finds a way to have a, a long weekend every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have a, there\'s always a Monday in the month off and they coincide with the us one. It probably as much as possible, although Thanksgiving is totally different time and oh yeah. so it\'s, it\'s interesting when you, you really, the rest of the world gets dragged along by the us holiday schedule, especially the big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopping ones and you know, nothing stops, email, doesn\'t stop, everything keeps going. And you know, sometimes it\'s a, it\'s a family day or , you know, a long weekend and no one else is, is, uh, aware of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> It sounds lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> It can be, yeah. I I\'ve been slow to, to adjust to it. They kind of sneak up on me. well, what are you, what are you anticipating doing at, um, at word camp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are you looking forward to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m looking forward to meeting a lot more people in the community. I\'ve only met a lot of people through, um, like Twitter, mostly and you know, the occasional popup on a podcast. So I\'m really excited to meet different people and talk with them and pick their brains. Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In private. So that\'s going to be very awesome. What about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, there\'s some, some lots of good talks. I\'m. wondering how I can fit that in and the hallway stuff. And there I\'ve, I\'ve met a, a number of our, our members and people. I happened to have known for a long time earlier this year at one, at a retreat we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but yeah, there will be a lot of people I meet for the first time. And it just, it seems like a lot to try to fit in at one point, but I\'m looking forward to contributor day where maybe someone where I can get, I can get. Oriented and, and doing something helpful. I, I, I really wanna get some time to, um, figure out how to ease into, to some things I can help with on a weekly basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s just been kind of nuts lately. So that\'s been tricky. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s gonna be awesome. I\'m really looking forward to that as well. Like I think with all of us in a room, it\'ll be a little easier than trying to, you know, do it over at the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh yeah. Yeah. There\'s so much stuff that can be explained directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Synchronis communication at least, or if someone right there at your shoulder, um, that, you know, one more tab, one more thing to read. You know, I find like after, you know, after the productive hours of, of work 3, 4, 5 hours of if it\'s reading intensive and man, I just have to read a lot of stuff. It, you just lose that attention and processing ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Do you find that? Do you just. Where you\'re trying to read, you\'re scanning through something and you just like, what, what am I, oh yeah. What is, what was this about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And constantly starting over. Oh yeah. it happens a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> and when you\'re actually trying to learn a workflow or a process or a tool or something like that, you kind of want to get it in muscle memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You wanna get it, or in some kind of whatever, part of your brain where you just don\'t have to like driving, you don\'t have to think about it. And, um, yeah, it\'s good to do that. First thing in the morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, is this your first work camp? Like big one? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> of any of any really? Um, when I was, um, first lived in a, in a city that was big enough to have things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I don\'t, I don\'t think Milwaukee\'s ever had a. I don\'t know. I wouldn\'t, I shouldn\'t say that there there\'s, there\'s a ton of WordPress people there mm-hmm um, I don\'t know if they\'ve had a, a word camp, but they didn\'t back then. So I was the, the little open source tech scene was taking off and it was mostly DRAL people around the Makerspace and those of us who did things in WordPress, where, um, well, WordPress was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite young at that point, I was more into Jula.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was that going on? So, you know, there was, there was kind of a general, there was a, um, bar camp that was a big deal, um, bar camp. What is that have bar camps like food bar? It was, um, it was not a platform specific thing, but it was getting dominated by the local Dal people and, uh, which I was totally into as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it was a more general, um, uh, coder camp hacker kind of hacker space filled up with tons of kids and. You know, we\'re all younger then. Um, and I\'m yeah. I\'m, I\'m curious about the age demographics, uh, you know, I, I feel WordPress and word camps. We really need to, um, find ways to diversify in all directions, including oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, I\'m definitely interested in that as well. my, um, husband actually asked me, he was like, is gonna be a lot of people your age. And I was like, I don\'t know. Um, you know, , I know in some people at the company, my age that are going, but I was like, I don\'t know. I was like, this is going to be an interesting experience and it\'s not just WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I\'ve been to a lot of other big, uh, tech conventions though, and conferences and meetups mm-hmm and they\'ve been pretty diverse in terms of age, um, even race as well. I\'m really interested to see how work camp compares, especially since I\'m going to all things open in November. I\'m really excited for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s in Raleigh. and yeah, I\'m just very excited for my first work camp. I\'m I\'m already like prepping to go to work camp Asia as well. So hopefully it just blows my mind and I wanna go to all of them. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> wish, I wish I, well, I may be a few more here and there, but yeah, I\'d love to, um, yeah, Raleigh, I lived there for a number of years and university years and they\'re not real nice, nice place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you\'ll have to write about that or tell us all about the all things. Yeah, we\'ll talk about it. Mm-hmm um, but more of a broad creator, uh, economy focused conference, I think. Right. Um, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, all things open source mm-hmm yeah. Yeah. So yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> age diversity is great. I like it. I I\'ve enjoyed when I went back to classroom university.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching part-time a few years back after raising my own kids. And it was totally different than when like 20 years before when I had started. And hadn\'t, you know, I was, I was barely older than my students. um, I don\'t know. The dead perspective is sometimes nice when you\'ve meowed out and understand people need connection and confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of technical skill, you know, otherwise they just think you\'re saying you\'re doing everything wrong. Mm-hmm and yeah. So it\'s, it\'s great to have all, all ages. I love having older people around too, for their experience and usually come or</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> approach. Are you, are you going to be in dad mode at work camp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I don\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> know. I don\'t know where I. I can come in at all. never really know. It depends on how much I sleep and I don\'t think there\'s that much sleeping that happens when you\'ve got party after party. Another other things going on. Um, yeah, I\'ll try to. Keep the energy up, but I\'m old. I ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you\'re not old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, I can fool people, but oh yeah. It\'s an old,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> so when we get to karaoke and it\'s time for our duet, I don\'t wanna hear you say, oh, now I can\'t do this. I\'m tired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> you pick a song yet? You got a place</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> where I have six or seven songs. So you can\'t tell me no, like, I\'m gonna say Dan, like you can\'t say no to all six</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> or seven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. As soon as I open my mouth, though, you\'re gonna be like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That\'s it? No, no, no. That\'s, that\'s what karaoke is for you. Don\'t take people who can sing to karaoke. That\'s the worst. That ruins karaoke</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> ah, yeah. Yeah. I haven\'t been in to one in a while. I like watching \'em there\'s a, a terrible place to eat dive bar, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they\'ve like two kinds of bad Canadian beer. Okay. Downtown here. And it\'s just a weird place, but it\'s, it\'s right down from a, a, a. tall building that has a, a lot of retired people in it. And there were these, um, cute elderly ladies that would, would come down there and do do it along with, it was just the weirdest group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was all ages and all love it kinds. And so, you know, some people were really fabulous at it and others were just fabulously. amateur and, um, you never know what you\'d get. It was, it was just great to watch. Um, I, I don\'t know that I\'ve seen that many. I\'ve definitely seen some, uh, in-home large house party, Asian karaoke that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it was just a D totally different thing. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I love it. We, we did Korean style karaoke in Vegas. And when was that? March? Oh my God. I loved it so much. We just had like buckets of Soju and like, we were singing all night and dancing. I had a tambourine. It was so great. I slept in the Uber on the way back to the whole hotel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>was wonderful. there\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> always someone who, who thinks they\'re really good and is really earnest. And they\'re, you know, the dog\'s starting to how and .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, that\'s me. That\'s me. Oh, that\'s me. I can\'t wait. Oh, that\'s me. I\'m ready. I\'m ready. I\'m so ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, I know. Mm. Yeah, I was, I was not trained properly, but at, at any kind of music really too bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My, my girls are, they\'ve had tons of tons of musical. Instruction, which they enjoy. But now I, I wanna kick their, their butts out into the street for busking. You can get be a licensed busker in Edmonton, in the summers. Um, but that\'s a totally different thing when you\'re performing live with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s a big, big confidence jump. Even if you do have the skills confidence. You gotta, you gotta push yourself out there and do it, I guess. So it\'s not, not my thing, but I wish I wish I could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Well, we will make them proud this year. Somehow. See if someone gets video, it\'ll be okay. Oh, well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> if anything ends up on the internet, that might be bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m I\'m not gonna share</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that. No it for, okay. We\'ll discuss this later, so, okay. What speakers or sessions are you most excited to see at word? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I want, well I\'m Robert Rowley is a fun, you know, wild and crazy guy. I\'ve enjoyed talking books and random things with, and, and security is he he\'s with he\'s the security advocate at patch stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. Uh, he\'s, he\'s giving a talk. He did a really cool, crazy thing he\'s done before he did for us, but he he\'s done mm-hmm before where he teaches lock, picking, it\'s sort of a side hobby and he uses it to talk about security and philosophy of life and, and all kinds of, um, things like that. And so I\'m sure he\'s gonna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entertaining and interesting. And it\'s, it\'s just security is a topic. I, I really like, and I\'ve paid more attention cuz he writes in podcasts about it quite a bit. Um, patch stack has a really cool, um, approach where they\'re, they\'re really encouraging collaboration through a network that they, um, I don\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it\'s a very, it\'s an open network. They sponsored, I, I guess they\'re kind of the ringleader, but anyone can, can join in the security profession and try to work to keep WordPress safe. I know they just, um, they partnered with hosting her to provide their, um, services. Um, both of those companies are, um, I think lot Vian, uh, mm-hmm multi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>business members of, of post status. And they\'re, it\'s nice to see people get together and collaborate. And so they\'re providing it is security, uh, heads up, Hey, update your stuff inside your hosting panel, if you\'re with hosting or, and I noticed that that last little, there was three security, um, uh, patches in the, the little maintenance and security release that, that went out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm. the other day, a few days ago, last week. Um, and you don\'t initially find out all the details about it. And Robert later, um, commented on it, that they were actually, the security stuff was, was hunted down. There\'s a WordPress bug bounty program. Google has one too, where you can get mm-hmm money by finding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was, it was something that couldn\'t actually likely be exploited, but, um, within the parameters of, I guess, finding. Some kind of proof of concept that something could be exploited under certain conditions. You, you know, they, they patch that, check it out, learn some things. And, uh, so I think everyone usually assumes that there\'s something bad going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like some bad guys found something or it\'s, it\'s at risk. And sometimes it\'s just penetration testing analysis from the good guys and then they\'re fixing it so nice. It should be good press when, when things get better and stronger, uh, what\'s your number one session, man? I like there\'s all kinds of good stuff in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think my favorite, favorite, favorite? is an anthropologist, a WordPress developer and a lawyer walking to a bar. Mm. Yeah. Cassandra Decker is doing that one about just communicating in the community, which is something I actually wrote about this, um, wrote about this week. And it talks about how to talk about talk with people in the community that may be from different walks of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that title really caught my eye because. I was interested in all three of these careers at one point, you know, I am a WordPress developer now I was interested in being an anthropologist. I even learned Latin for it. oh, really? And the, yeah, I\'m reading the Hobbit in Latin right now. My Latin is like S shotty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a while ago, but I\'m trying to relearn it. So I\'m reading the Hobbit in Latin and then I also was accepted in the law school, but I didn\'t. So I was like, oh, I\'m really, I\'m really interested in this. And I\'m interested in what she has to say. And, you know, it\'s always, I\'m always interested in opening up communication in the community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s my absolute favorite. I\'m not missing that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. That sounds really interesting. I love it. When people do interdisciplinary things or break out of the bubble and, and stuff like that. Mm-hmm , um, I, I didn\'t know that. So, you know, you\'re such. Non argumentative personality. I wouldn\'t think law would be attractive to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you making</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> fun of me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, you\'d be a great lawyer. Um, you\'re making</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> fun of me. Oh my God. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Latin. Um, yeah, I, I had to crash course one summer. Um, when I was doing, I did up to some level of, of graduate work in literature and. Literary cultural studies and Renaissance medieval stuff. And yeah, so we have these odd, odd backgrounds we could have might have explored at at one point, but language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You never really, you can\'t never go wrong. Like that\'s just cool to know, but you must be pretty good if you can read any of, of the Hobbit in, in Latin, which is crazy because Tolkin. Was this major, you know, Brian has probably, if, if you\'re not a token buff, Brian cords is probably said quite a few things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He seems to be quite a fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Mm. Um, I, I really like him a lot. Um, my grandmother actually, she had a copy of the Hobbit. I started reading. I tried to read when I was really young and I was like, okay, that goes back on the shelf. And then I read at a later age. So in order to help, I also have it in Spanish. I can speak Spanish and speaking Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess my limited English I\'m, I\'m joking. Um, Latin comes. It comes kind of easy when I can recognize it, you know, in different languages and I\'m learning Korean right now, so, oh yeah, I know that right. Duo. Yeah. So I\'ll probably eventually get the ho in Korean. So I guess</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the Hobbit would be easier than Lord of the rings cuz oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>yeah. I was trying to imagine, like, how would you do Latin? Does Tolkin knew so many languages? Mm-hmm and then he makes. All these Elish languages and different ways of writing it, the war and, or, oh yeah. All these things. Like how, how would you flatten that? All I\'ve always been curious about that. I, haven\'t not gotten fluent enough in another language to really feel, you know, like how do, when you\'re representing an, a different language mm-hmm, in your own language, like, um, Hemingway like used these and thousand and stuff when he\'s like, I think people are speaking in Spanish and, and things, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it was in for whom the bell tolls mm-hmm how do you indicate a foreign language? You can do kind of dialect or accents and stuff, but, um, that would be tough, especially to learn, I guess, you know, you\'re fluent. If you\'re reading a foreign language and you\'re reading their creative manipulation of it to pretend to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>doing another foreign language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. The books I have. Um, I read them on my iPad because, you know, anytime I don\'t understand anything, I can just click and find the word or find the, a reference for the phrase. But they\'re geared toward people who already speak English, who are trained to learn these other languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it was something I discovered, cuz I was gonna start with children\'s book. I was like, okay, I\'ll get like cat and a hat in Latin and stuff like that, which I did find some of those as well. And then it was like some people have, they were like the. It\'s written in different languages and, um, they have learning ones geared toward English speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, oh my God. Yes. Cause I love the habit. I was reading it like every year at one point. So it was like, I\'m, I\'m so familiar with it in English, maybe, you know, it\'ll help. And then like I was on the first page in Latin for like three days. I was like, okay, let\'s just break all of this down. And then Spanish, you know, I was going a little faster cuz I can read Spanish, probably the best I can speak it, but I can read it the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s just getting a really familiar. That you\'re really familiar with and going for it in a different language. I feel like that\'s very helpful. You know, the most helpful is talking to people, but the second most helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, yeah, I, I envy that. I wish I, um, had time to go back and, and do more of languages and, and just reading, um, books, uh, and fiction again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I was, yeah, early, that was one of the, the first big books. I read all the tol and stuff. And we had a record, my brother and I , we had a record where it was a, it was like, it was based on the cartoon version of the Hobbit and the dramatic reading. Yeah. I\'ve seen it. Yeah. I could probably do the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> love it. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Well, what else is is cool in, in here? I know, um, Molana cap is, is doing, is teaching, um, WP CLI do you use that at all? I\'ve it\'s been a long time since I played around with it, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I do, I do cool. it doesn\'t make me the happiest, but I do. Cool. No, it\'s cool. I it\'s, I, I know it\'s useful. I just it\'s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not, yeah, it\'s not WSP CLI it\'s me. I\'m the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> She\'s on that. I know that one kind of jumped. Oh, and the performance, there\'s a performance session with the Felix arts toos going to he\'s on the performance team and has had a, a lot to contribute on that. So, um, I\'m not sure. I guess, talking, talking about, um, performance at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m not sure if this is geared towards probably developers. Hosting people. I\'m just, I\'m curious what, what I might learn there. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I like a WordPress for the next generation. Mm. Um, that\'s the one I\'m very interested in. I think Columbia, I\'m so sorry if I say your name, wrong Hodge is doing it. Just talking about, um, entry, uh, barriers for young people and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I talk a lot about that. I\'m very excited and, um, it\'s going to be a business talk. So I\'m very excited to go to that one as well, and like soak up knowledge so I can like turn around and use it to help people that\'s get into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s really, I important. Have you, so you\'re the meetups that you\'re working on starting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How how\'s that going along? Do you think you\'ll reach a younger demographic with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, I\'ve had, um, there are people who weren\'t even that I\'m mentoring in tech that weren\'t interested in. WordPress. They\'re interested in now solely after everything I\'ve said to them solely because they know that we\'re, they\'re going to be meetups near them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they know that they\'ll be, you know, someone nearby to talk to. About getting into the community versus trying to do it all online. As we talk about, it\'s so hard to get it\'s. So it\'s hard for people in the community to kind of branch out and communicate online. So imagine how hard it is for people who are new and, you know, just having that in person meet up or that person nearby and to be able to meet other people in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s already getting people, you know, my age and younger, who wants to come into the community. So I think it\'s going to be like a big push for word present in these areas that I\'m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Yeah, that\'s really needed. And, um, I hope, hope we\'ll hear more about the mentoring program that Josepha floated on, on Twitter says his, um, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> In the words I\'m so excited. I\'m so excited about that. I cannot wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Um, really, really an important one, I think. And cuz it does so many things at, at once it\'s um, this just good for people and, and. Relationships, um, anchors people in meaning and, and value that, um, you know, it\'s very basic human stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if we were just training people, technically, you know, that\'s, that\'s not that that\'s not that interesting. Yeah. Mm-hmm ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I mean, it\'s needed to, but yeah, you\'re right. It\'s not that interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> well, it\'s always an open source. It\'s always tended to. A culture and belonging mm-hmm and, um, mentoring is really what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a better way to, to approach it, um, to give people not just training options, but relationship options, where you\'re learning from a real person, who\'s connects to other people in this cooperative project. That\'s that\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, I\'m really excited. This is to be so awesome. Like, I, I don\'t sound as excited as I am because I\'m tired, but I will have energy Thursday when I get there Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Do I get there Thursday? I should probably look into that. It\'s Tuesday, but yeah, I will have a lot of energy when I get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I don\'t miss. All right. Miss your flight. Uh</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh yeah, no, I\'m flying with, uh, one of my coworkers, so she\'s not gonna let me miss my flight. Thank God. How long</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is it for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You prob you might have further to go than, than me. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it\'s only four and a half hours. Five. You gotta direct know it\'s not five, four and a half. Yeah, I got, I got a nonstop direct from Charlotte. So I\'m only 15 minutes away from the airport. I discovered this weekend when I was picking my brother and uncle up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am not far at all from the airport. That is lovely because when I stayed in South Carolina, I would have to drive either an hour and a half to Charlotte to FL somewhere or two hours to Charleston. And it sucked . So it was a all day travel event to go places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. That\'s. Eh, travel can be the older you get the, not such a fun thing, but, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> well, it\'s better without kids along some of the time, but uh, older, older kids. Um, but I\'m going on my own, but yeah, no direct flights anymore. Uh, from, from here, I, I don\'t think, but it\'s about six hours altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> What\'s the first thing you\'re doing when you, when you land, like what, what\'s the first thing you want to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Huh? I don\'t know. I\'ll just, uh, I\'ll get over to the place, get over to the joint and unpack, uh, see what\'s going on. I\'m sure people will be pretty well assembled by then. um, gotcha. The town and country. Um, I don\'t know if I don\'t get I\'ll probably want, want to quick do that and then find somewhere to. Um, late or, well, I\'ll probably do that in the way it\'ll be fairly late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don\'t know. It might just step out. That\'s so interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. We, there might be like good, good night street food. I don\'t know. This is my first time in San Diego. I\'m really excited. So. , I don\'t know the first thing I\'m doing. I think I\'m enjoying being in California. I love California. I don\'t care what part put me in it I\'ll go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s my first thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I never really been in the Northern end of it. It would probably be more my speed. I don\'t know, originally from the Northeast and a lot of time in the Midwest and in south it\'s, uh, I\'m kind of biased on the Eastern end of the the country and, um, people who aren\'t that relaxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> whatever</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I need. I need a certain amount of road rage around, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, oh, I\'m sure you\'ll get that. I feel like , that\'s that\'s American the American way. No,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I don\'t miss that, but you know, I, I did like the Northeastern, um, punchiness of, oh, it\'s not necessarily unfriendly, but willingness to engage with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Blunt, blunt, strangers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. The. Seinfeld experience isn\'t too, too far off the reality, or maybe as it used to be. I, I always enjoy, um, living in a, in a city where you can\'t really control or predict, predict what\'s gonna happen in public space. And, um, for all the soup around here, I haven\'t found a soup Nazi yet, but there\'s usually there\'s usually a good place or some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food mogul who controls access to the, the good bond me or something like that. And you gotta please them to make sure. You\'re getting the good stuff</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> now I\'m hungry. I love bombing. I\'m so hungry. Yeah. I that\'s, I really want to, yeah. I wanna try like good Italian and Mexican. I heard it\'s really good in San Diego, but also I wanna try some really good, different Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my, I don\'t know if I\'ll have enough stomach for</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'ll follow you around. Yeah. I\'ve. Enjoy that a lot too. And Edmonton\'s great for all things, Asian and really just in general, it\'s surprising. Um, when you move out here, not knowing anything about it, how much, uh, how much there is and good eats, um, Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. The tacos. Um, I\'ve been making margaritas lately cuz the summer\'s ending and I don\'t know, I just got inspired to, uh, to do that. It\'s a really nice drink. I, Milwaukee was great for Mexican. I missed a lot of the places that were were there. That\'s and they\'re a little weak on that. Maybe here. There\'s a few good few good places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Well, I guess next week, we\'re going to talk about like food, right? Like where we ate at work camp. mm-hmm yeah, this is where the word press community ate during word camp with Dan and I, I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> like it. I know there\'s a contingent. That\'s all interested in the, um, in and out burger. I don\'t know if they\'re big Laki fans, but I\'ve never been to an in and out burger, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I love in and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I eat it every time I go to the west coast, I have to eat it like. It\'s not, I couldn\'t even tell you why it\'s so good. It\'s like, not even great, but I love it. And I\'m yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Hmm. I don\'t have to try it. I, I don\'t know. I mean, I\'m neutral. um, sounds kind of like the white castle, you know, for. Chicago people. Um, don\'t get a bunch of sliders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the first time as a kid, when I was Chicago, you have to go to white, white castle. Um, I don\'t know if that\'s even a thing anymore. I miss, um, I haven\'t heard people mention that in a long time. And man from North Carolina, I don\'t, I, I miss the, just the. Franchise unpredictable barbecues and big victims and spicy stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, uh, BOJ angles had was really good. Hot curly fries, poor BOJ</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> angles. what that, yeah. That\'s where everybody comes here and wants Bojangles. Um, is that considered</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> good? My brother walked there when he was in high school once and he\'d get all these bags of curly fries. The only thing I liked. Oh. And.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone had like milkshakes with big chunks of peach in them in</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> the summer cook cookout, cookout. That\'s what people like here. They like to come get cookout and Bojangles mm-hmm Bojangles is good. I do like Bojangles cookout is okay. Um, I, I see the, I see the nostalgia and stuff. Why people like it personally, and I hope nobody from North Carolina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is like listening in, sorry, Dan. I think the barbecue is way better in South Carolina. I have not been inspired yet to eat more barbecue here. I\'m actually like every time I go home, I eat barbecue cuz I\'m like, I just can\'t eat it in North Carolina, but it\'s only been a month. I\'ll give North Carolina about two more chances to get me some good barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be true,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but I\'d take, I take anything. No, one\'s no one\'s doing it up. Um, no, that, that was the Mississippi culture guaranteed that there was always a Sunday Southern barbecue somewhere in Milwaukee. Mm-hmm but uh, I\'ve missed. a long time since then. And you might be right. I was in Aiken, uh, outside Columbia mm-hmm South Carolina, 1993 in the summer at this that\'s a beautiful old town, these big streets and trees pre automobile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and there was a staying at this kind of cool little. Old fashioned estate that is probably as old as the town. And, uh, they brought in a, um, a, uh, bluegrass band and, you know, roasting the pig in the mm-hmm back garden for eight hours or so, I dunno, it takes a long time. Um, yeah, that was good. That\'s the most memorable one I\'ve I\'ve been at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah. You gotta come to South Carolina. I would invite you now, but it\'s like two last minute, but you know, SU the Southern funeral. So I\'ve been back and forth for a funeral arrangements and oh yeah. When I, last time I went, they had burnt ends, macaroni and cheese, barbecue hash, and like chopped barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hash rice, which people probably don\'t know what hash is outside of the south. Mm. Um, uh, they had cream corn and like stuffing and, uh, coleslaw and baked beans and ribs. And I was like, oh my God. Yeah. Somebody make a, made a five. Flavored pound cake. Like I was like, I gotta go. Y\'all like, I\'ve gained too much weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I have to go. I have to see people this week. Like my cheeks are swollen. Like everybody know let\'s everybody stop cooking. And then they\'re like, well, we\'re frying chicken tomorrow. Please stop everybody. Stop. please. You</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> got reminded of your mortality. You may as well eat well</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you\'re right. Move yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> You\'re right along, faster, down. Hard to attack</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> trackers. I\'m I\'m here for a good time. Not a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, it\'s hard to, hard to pass up. Good, good food. Yeah. Maybe I\'ll make it back out to the so Southeast sometime and yeah, I miss, I been away long enough from a place to, to start to. Miss or remember things affectionately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh yeah. And I gotta bring you your moon pies. I remember you said yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Little things like that from man. I don\'t miss working outside in the summers there though. I I\'ll come in the winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, do, yeah, we have two weeks of winter now, so you\'ll be completely fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Awesome. Oh, well that\'s gonna warm here too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, I will let you and I. Get through our short week here and oh yeah. Try to pack our bags and, and then, yeah, we\'re gonna sounds like we\'re gonna have a good time. Yeah. We\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> gonna meet up in San Diego. We can\'t have a bad time. I\'m not gonna have a bad time. So you\'re not gonna have a bad time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. All right.

In 2014, the company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-open-sources-its-dmca-process-docs-on-github\">open sourced its DMCA takedown process documents</a> to help others implement their own processes. Past transparency reports have included information on intellectual property disputes, IRUs (reports from dedicated government Internet Referral Units), national security letters, government information requests, and other issues related to hosted content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Automattic published a <a href=\"https://transparency.automattic.com/\">unified landing page</a> for WordPress.com and Tumblr&#8217;s transparency reports, which are now hosted on the same site, aimed at making it easier to navigate and compare the data. In the future this may include the company&#8217;s other products like Day One and Pocket Casts, as relevant requests come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent <a href=\"https://transparency.automattic.com/2022/09/07/transparency-report-update-january-june-2022/\">report</a> for the first half of 2022, includes information on the Russian censorship requests WordPress.com received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over the past six months, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have seen a marked increase in the number of takedown demands that target content which is critical of the Russian government and associates,&#8221; WordPress.com Community Guardian Stephen McLeod Blythe said. He cited specific examples relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fundraising for Ukranian aid</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Outlining Russian history with a perspective on what led to the war in Ukraine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alleging criminal activity on the part of Russian oligarchs, and their personal connections to Putin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publishing commentary from former Russian soldiers who were critical of the military involvement in Ukraine</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In all of these cases, given our concerns about access to critical information from within Russia, and the implications for freedom of expression, we made the determination that we would&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;geoblock the content at issue,&#8221; Blythe said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also included information on how Automattic resolved IP blocks from two major ISPs in Colombia, after the country blocked Tumblr without disclosing the reason. Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Technologies and Communications had blocked the service after discovering a spam blog on the network. Despite the fact that Automattic had already removed the blog, the process of unblocking Tumblr took months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Situations such as these are not uncommon, and, as the above example demonstrates, the issue of government censorship online or regional platform blocks cannot be reflected solely by the numbers of takedown demands that are received,&#8221; Blythe said. &#8220;As a result, we are committed to continually reviewing and expanding the information that we are able to share in our transparency report.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Sep 2022 21:16:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2022 Kicks Off Today, Free Livestream Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137691\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2022-kicks-off-today-free-livestream-available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2178:\"<p>WordCamp US 2022 is underway in San Diego, California, following last night&#8217;s welcome party for speakers, sponsors, organizers, and volunteers.

Organizers received <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Style+Variation%22\">38 submissions</a> from 19 contributors (some submitted multiple variations) hailing from eight countries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the wide range of colors and typography combinations, TT3 is gearing up to be a vehicle for a diverse set of styles from WordPress&#8217; community of designers. Submissions included creative variations for all kinds of design moods &#8211; dark with high contrast, bright yellow with a smaller universal type size, a gradient aubergine background, and many more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic design director Channing Ritter <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/09/07/tt3-default-theme-announcing-style-variation-selections/\">published</a> the selections that made the cut to be shipped with Twenty Twenty-Three:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These variations were selected in an effort to feature the most drastically different set of variations possible — so in many ways, we were looking at what would work best as a collection versus selecting our favorite standalone submissions,&#8221; Ritter said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The selections are not in their final form. Contributors will continue iterating on them, under the direction of design team leaders, until the WordPress 6.1 beta period begins on September 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some of the changes suggested may be a bit aspirational, but let’s continue pushing to see how opinionated we can make each of these variations,&#8221; Ritter said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Submissions that were not chosen to ship with TT3 may still have a path towards inclusion via an official child theme of the default theme. Contributors <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/73\">discussed</a> how this might work and have closed the issue in favor of creating a separate project for it after TT3 has launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I particularly like the idea of continuing to create style variations beyond those that are bundled with TT3,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored contributor Sarah Norris said. &#8220;I think this is a great opportunity to introduce people to block themes and building variations, with the help of the community and experienced block-themers. It also provides a space to test Gutenberg PRs, in a similar way to how <code>emptytheme</code> is currently used, but with more opinionated settings enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure about this being part of the current TT3 project, and in my opinion, it would be best to start this initiative soon after TT3 has launched.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, contributors plan to refine the selected variations, and the child theme project can proceed without affecting the theme&#8217;s current timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/09/07/tt3-default-theme-announcing-style-variation-selections/#comment-26608\">announcement</a> to see each of the selected variations in more detail.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 21:21:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: Anders Norén Releases Björk, a Free WordPress Block Theme for Blogs and Personal Websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-releases-bjork-a-free-wordpress-block-theme-for-blogs-and-personal-websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3853:\"<p>WordPress theme author Anders Norén is at it again with a new&nbsp;minimal block theme for blogs and personal websites.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bjork/\">Björk</a> is the 129th block theme to hit the directory and Norén&#8217;s 25th free WordPress theme. It follows the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/poe-a-bold-new-portfolio-theme-with-30-block-patterns-and-10-style-variations\">release of Poe</a>, a portfolio style theme, less than two months ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Norén said he is a fan of the Icelandic singer, his new theme is named for his favorite tree. Björk is the Swedish name for birch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Birch trees are incredibly resilient, which is why you can find them closer to the tree line on the Swedish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fell\">fjäll</a>&nbsp;than any other type of tree,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;They’re also very pretty to look at.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The default style for the theme certainly has a birch-like appearance with its white background and use of <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Albert+Sans\">Albert Sans</a>, a Google font designed by Danish type designer Andreas Rasmussen who was inspired by the type-characteristics of Scandinavian architects and designers in the early 20th century.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop viewers will see a sticky sidebar menu for quick navigation links. This disappears on smaller screen sizes in favor of a hamburger menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Björk has a very classic blog theme structure, with a sidebar navigation to the left and the content to the right,&#8221; Norén said in a post <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/introducing-bjork/\">introducing the new theme</a>. &#8220;You’ve seen hundreds of these WordPress themes before – I’ve released like six of them myself – but with the advent of block themes, everything old is new again. There aren’t a lot of block themes with this structure on the theme directory yet.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Björk includes seven different theme styles, in addition to the default, which can instantly change the look of the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Norén has also included more than 15 block patterns, which enable users to mix and match and quickly build their own layouts for the front page or other pages. Patterns include designs for featured items with an image, heading, paragraph and button, a testimonials section, multiple hero patterns, call-to-action patterns, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When you install and activate the theme for the first time, you get all of the layouts in place, including the front page. This makes it easy for users to get started by simply replacing the content or rearranging it to suit their unique needs. <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/themes/bjork/\">Check out the demo</a> to see approximately how it will look once installed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Björk was built using Norén&#8217;s Davis Blocks theme as a foundation, the same framework used to build Poe, his last release. It&#8217;s a small package, with just 500 lines of CSS and no JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Björk is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/bjork/\">download for free on WordPress.org</a> or via the &#8220;Add New&#8221; themes screen in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Site Editor has really come a long way in a short amount of time,&#8221;  Norén said. &#8220;The most noticeable difference is that I’m having a lot more fun building block themes now compared to when I released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/tove-wordpress-theme/\">Tove</a>, my first block theme, a year ago.

To give some context for how old these versions are, in 2013, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-7-released-wordpress-now-updates-itself\">WordPress 3.7 introduced automatic background updates</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released\">3.8 updated the admin</a> with a new design <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/\">based on the MP6 plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; official policy is that the security team only provides support for the most recent version, but as a courtesy has extended backporting security fixes to older versions that are able to receive automatic updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until now, these courtesy backports have included all versions of WordPress supporting automatic updates,&#8221; 10up-sponsored Security Team member Peter Wilson said. &#8220;Versions WordPress 3.7 – 4.0 have reached levels of usage, namely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">less than 1% of total installs</a>, where the benefit of providing these updates is outweighed by the effort involved.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than half of all WordPress sites are on the latest version &#8211; 6.0+ (54.3%), and security updates will still be available to more than 99% of sites on older versions after this change. Wilson said the decision to drop support for 3.7 through 4.0 was based off the information reported on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">statistics</a> page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress version stats</a> &#8211; 9/7/2022\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The effect of this imbalance means that the Security team spends most of the time preparing backports for the vast minority of WordPress installations,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;By dropping support for these older versions, the newer versions of WordPress will become more secure as more time can be focused on their needs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next three months, versions 4.0 and older will receive their final updates and will also display a non-dismissible notice in the dashboard, advising users to upgrade to the latest version as their sites will no longer receive security updates.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 16:37:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WordPress.org blog: Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1323:\"<p>As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These versions of WordPress were first released eight or more years ago so the vast majority of WordPress installations run a more recent version of WordPress.

The PR he referenced (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/41740\">#41740</a>) is an extension of those explorations that takes the mode even further towards the objective of removing visual clutter when the focus is on editing text content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Until now the preference, when toggled on, would only hide some of the toolbar icons and a few other non-essential UI items,&#8221; Draganescu said. &#8220;With this PR the preference will have a more drastic effect, turning the UI into a blank page.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the previous explorations were more focused on&nbsp;removing UI from the canvas, the demo video above shows how Draganescu&#8217;s PR takes it even further to create a full-page writing-focused environment.

It makes it easier to build templates without worrying about block editing. Draganescu said if this code lands, it may lend some foundation to the distraction free mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature has generally received positive feedback, with a few minor suggestions to correct issues with dismissing the screen and the autosave message. The team does not seem to be in a rush to land distraction free mode in Gutenberg but significant progress has been made over the past six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With distractions increasing in the the digital world, some of the most reliable and efficient interfaces are those committed to staying distraction free. The current Fullscreen mode falls short here, as different parts of the interface pop in and out of view when the mouse is moved around the screen. Draganescu&#8217;s attempt at making a new, distraction free UI, more tailored to writing, would be a welcome addition to Gutenberg.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 01:47:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"Do The Woo Community: Builder Tips from WordCampUS Speakers Part_3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72861\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://dothewoo.io/builder-tips-from-wordcampus-speakers-part_3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:417:\"<p>Tips from Rich Tabor, Cassandra Decker, Robert Rowley, Daisy Olsen, Ronnie Burt, Amber Hinds, Jonathan Desrosiers and Ronald Gijsel</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/builder-tips-from-wordcampus-speakers-part_3/\">Builder Tips from WordCampUS Speakers Part_3</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Sep 2022 11:31:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Post Status: What is a WordPress developer?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=121418\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://poststatus.com/what-is-a-wordpress-developer/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1186:\"<p>That was <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/whats-a-wordpress-developer/\">the question</a> on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/defining-a-worpress-developer/\">an episode</a> of <strong>Woo DevChat</strong> with <strong>Ebonie Butler</strong>, <strong>Lisa Canini</strong>, <strong>Robbie Adair</strong>, and <strong>Kathy Zant</strong>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Sep 2022 12:01:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #72 Gutenberg 13.9, 14.0, WordPress 6.02, Themes and Design Tools\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=22015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-72-gutenberg-14-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49121:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack and Nick Diego discuss highlights from Gutenberg 13.9, 14.0, WordPress 6.02, Themes and Design Tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-69-gutenberg-releases-wordpress-6-0-1-the-create-block-theme/#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-69-gutenberg-releases-wordpress-6-0-1-the-create-block-theme/#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nick Diego</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>developer advocate at WP Engine, plugin developer and themes builder.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 13.9, Gutenberg 14.01, WordPress 6.02, and a lot of things about themes and design tools in the editor. And I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress Developer Advocate. And today, I have a special guest on the show, it&#8217;s Nick Diego, Developer Advocate at WP Engine, Plugin Developer, and Themes Builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just learned he is also from the hospitality industry. So, we have a whole new show. He&#8217;s also a Core Contributor on WordPress and running triage sessions every Tuesday in the core editor channel. And he&#8217;s also a teammate of mine on the 6.1 release squad. Good afternoon, Nick. Thank you so much for coming to the show today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, sure. I should probably also mention that you were part of the group of experts on the developer hours meet up, where a group of contributors answer questions from the audience. We should schedule some more, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego:</em> We should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, in the meantime, until that happens, you held or will hold also build up basics events on the learn WordPress online meetup, thank you for those. Most events were recorded and are uploaded to WordPress TV. So, you get a lot of Nick Diego on WordPress TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, what have you learned that&#8230; what are the most common concepts that are harder to understand for people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego:</em> Well, first of all, those online workshops are so important for engaging directly with the community and WordPress builders. A lot of people aren&#8217;t keeping up with what&#8217;s happening in Gutenberg, they have businesses to run, websites to build, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress is developing so quickly as we&#8217;ll see in today&#8217;s episode with all the things that have happened in the latest releases. And so, it&#8217;s a great time to connect with them and just to cover the basics. One of my main series is builder basics, where we talk about really the fundamentals, like how to work with row blocks and group blocks and that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think people really get a lot out of that. And so, I&#8217;m also really excited for the new 2023 theme because it&#8217;s going to incorporate a lot of the new functionality that we&#8217;re seeing in WordPress and provide users a place to look and see a working functional example of all the new stuff that&#8217;s coming in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a couple ways. There are online workshops and all the other developer relations stuff that we&#8217;re doing, hopefully, we can help get people up to speed more quickly than they would on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, if you don&#8217;t have them signed up for the meetup yet, where you get all the announcements of all the new workshops that are coming there. Sometimes, there are months with 2025 workshops. Well, month of August wasn&#8217;t so good because we were&#8230; many of the faculty were on vacation, but definitely sign up and join the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, there are 20. Sometimes, there are 60 in there, I have noticed. And most of them are recorded. So, even if you&#8217;ve missed them&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to watch the recording when there is some life interaction with people in there. So, Nick, you mentioned the 2023 theme and the update here is that the theme is a base theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was a call for the community to send in style variations, that&#8217;s style variations, or something like a skin of a theme that follows the theme, but you can change color, fonts, and other things, spacings, and all the good things. And the community submitted actually 33 style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And next week, the team will learn&#8230; the team will decide which ones are bundled with the default theme. And I look through them, I like quite a few. So, did you get a look at them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I did. I did. And some of my fellow colleagues submitted a couple. It&#8217;s a really exciting project, reach out into the community and get designs from other community members, it really makes you feel like this is a community project and WordPress is open-source and we have a big community. I really like the direction they took with this and the designs that have come out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there are all voices in the community that you don&#8217;t need, every year new theme, just add new styling there or so not every WordPress is going to change a theme every year, so. But you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s actually the reference theme for all the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if the listeners want to learn more about style variations and how to create them and what it was working on one of them for the 2023 theme, Justin Tadlock, takes you along in his new post on his experience designing the style variations on the Gutenberg Times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I love this sentiment, although there are 1,400 words in there, but I&#8217;m just picking those from Justin&#8217;s post. So, there was a&#8230; and I quote them. “So, there was a small part of me that remembered exactly why I fell in love with WordPress in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like that same 21-year old kid who had just learned to edit a theme style CSS file to make some minor color changes. This was the WordPress that I remembered from so long. The one where themes were not hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code.” So, back to the basics and back to just do change the styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s such a great quote from Justin and I completely agree. I think that because with block themes and this movement that we&#8217;re on, it&#8217;s really making themes a lot more accessible, it&#8217;s brand new, so it&#8217;s something new that you need to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is creating simpler themes that can be visually unique with just a few lines of code. And I think that provides a lot of power to users, especially in the low code, no code movement, I think there&#8217;s a lot of exciting things happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s back to the thinkers that can just change some things and have immediate gratification that they see it right away. There is no build spot on. There is no PHP thing or, yeah. So, it&#8217;s good. Well, WordCamp US is coming up next week. I am so excited to go to San Diego on Wednesday night. I can hardly wait. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;ll be there Thursday, but yeah. No, this is actually my first WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I was planning to go the 2022 one, but then the world fell apart. So, yeah, I&#8217;m very excited to be going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Well, awesome. Yeah. So, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m going to see you there. So, I knew that you would be there, but I didn&#8217;t know that was your first WordCamp, so yeah. Go through that post on, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s what WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe what to do when it&#8217;s your first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I saw that, yeah. I saw that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s so spot on. Yeah. So, don&#8217;t worry dear listeners, if you didn&#8217;t get a ticket, there will be live streams of the talks and workshops, and they will all be recorded and available on records to be sometime later this year. So, there are quite a few block editor-related talks on the schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Alex Ball will talk about customizing core blocks for clients. Very interesting topic. I have lots of discussions about that topic. Evan Mullins has a talk titled FSE for the win, it&#8217;s a lightning talk. And Daisy Olsen&#8217;s workshop on Saturday morning is about creating your first block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rich Tabor, always a great presenter, will talk about the new era of WordPress themes is here, block themes. And I saw you on the roster of a lightning talk. What will it be about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, the title of my talk is a little, I guess, attention grabbing it&#8217;s build a custom block in 15 minutes. So, the goal of this presentation is to demystify the complexities of block development in WordPress. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve heard a lot. Oh, building block is really challenging. It requires new skills, whether it&#8217;s JavaScript or React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea behind this is to show that you can actually build something quite functional in a short amount of time. And hopefully, inspire the&#8230; either that you&#8217;re watching it through the live stream or you&#8217;re attending, inspire people to build their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I&#8217;d be the first person to say that building blocks can be challenging depending on the complexity of your project, but it&#8217;s never been easier to get started with block development. We&#8217;ll actually talk about it later today. But there have been so many tools built by the WordPress community that makes getting started with block development easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you combine that with some of the internal block supports, some block controls that are available directly from WordPress. And you can really get started pretty quickly in less than 15 minutes as I will demonstrate. So, very excited to be giving the presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;m probably going to sneak in there. I&#8217;m going to be in the accessibility testing workshop, but I will sneak out and come see your talk. I hope that everyone&#8217;s punctual there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Hopefully, I can do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We know afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But what are the other talks that you are interested in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: So, I&#8217;m really interested in&#8230; well, I’m very excited to see Rich&#8217;s talk. And as you mentioned, Rich is a great presenter. But I&#8217;m excited to learn more about things I don&#8217;t know much about. So, there&#8217;s getting started with WP-CLI, CLI. And then, there&#8217;s another one by WordPress Through the Terminal by Milana Cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t know much about them. And I think it&#8217;d be a great opportunity to learn more. It’s one of the areas of WordPress that I should be better at, so I&#8217;m excited to learn from those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. Both are great presenters. So, if you&#8217;re in San Diego, the listeners, and we cross path, please don&#8217;t be shy. Introduce yourself. And I want to meet you. And even if I&#8217;m in a conversation with others at WordCamps, we try to follow the PacMan rule, I don&#8217;t know. Do you know about that, Nick?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I learned of it, but I did not know prior to seeing the description here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, when we stand in a group of people and you always do, you have two people, then another one came said, &#8220;Hey, glad to see you.&#8221; And then, you talk about things, you chat together. We don&#8217;t make close circles. We always leave one opening so other people can walk in and join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s an explicit permission to join a new group of people. And that&#8217;s how you meet people. That&#8217;s how the community works. So, definitely welcome to do this, and I will always make sure there is a spot for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, we are on the section of community contributions. And Ryan Welcher did a Twitch stream this week about the new features of the create-block package. And I have actually the YouTube link for you and the show notes because he just finished uploading it to YouTube. Twitch only saves the video for 14 days and that&#8217;s&#8230; so, Ryan always downloads them and uploads them to YouTube, he edits them sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he was exploring the new release of the WordPress create-block package. And he thinks it&#8217;s a game changer. I think so, too. So, he goes over the new features, the flags for the, speaking of CLI, the flags of the terminal program for no plugin and variant flags that have been added to the tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These flags increase the usability because they allow the users to add a new block to an existing plugin and or theme, and also provide the ability for a template to provide different variants for a block, like either a dynamic block or a static version, for instance. So, it&#8217;s going to be a really cool if you, yeah, do you want to say something about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, a little bit of sneak peek. So, the create-block package is absolutely fantastic. I will actually be using the create-block package during my presentation, that&#8217;s what makes it possible to build a block in 15 minutes. So, there&#8217;s really no way to get started with block development. And Ryan&#8217;s did a fantastic job both working on the package itself, and then also educating folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He actually runs an online workshop through the meetup, through the training team as well talking about building custom block. So, can&#8217;t say enough good things about Ryan and the work he&#8217;s done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. No, I feel the same way. If you are more the reading type learner, Ryan also updated documentation pages for the create-block package. And we have the link in the show note, and there&#8217;s also an added section to it for how to create templates for the tool, your custom templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you can use them for agency specific scaffolding and standardize some of the work there as well. Okay, got that done. Speaking of themes and I have the feeling there will be more talk about themes or, yeah. Anne McCarthy gathered about 15 theme developers from the community from the FSE program, FSE, Full Site Editing Outreach Program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they discussed various aspects of theme development with Full Site Editing and starts also Figma and design systems was a topic, and how they can work together with the theme JSON. Figma also has a theme, a JSON file operation, then custom block development, or how to organize pattern libraries in her post and concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I quote, &#8220;While there is both excitement and interest in what block themes unlock.&#8221; It&#8217;s also clear that there is a buildup of pain points to address whether through clearer resources or changes to good look itself. Now, besides that conclusion is, if you are a theme developer hearing from people who already worked with block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some of them are no strangers to our listeners, it&#8217;s Ellen Bauer, Carolina Nymark, Rich Tabor, Ana Zagora, Herb Miller. It&#8217;ll jump your discovery or speed up your knowledge. So, I really urge you to just listen into people talking about the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress 6.0.2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So, now, let&#8217;s move on to the releases. First up is the WordPress 6.0 release. It&#8217;s a security maintenance release with a few bug fixers for the block editor. And it was released, I forgot, it was, I think, August 30th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Something like that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But there was one thing in there that you worked mainly on it, that&#8217;s allow remote pattern registration in theme JSON when code patterns are disabled. So, what was that about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, I&#8217;ll give you props for originally flagging this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And it&#8217;s where a lot of times, theme developers want to disable the core patterns that come with WordPress. You&#8217;re building your theme and you want to provide your own patterns, which makes perfect sense. And there&#8217;s an easy flag to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But unfortunately, when you would do that, you would basically turn off your ability to pull down patterns from the pattern directory. So, it stymied the growth of the pattern directory, because theme developers couldn&#8217;t both use their own patterns, shut down the core patterns and then pull down from the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, this little, fairly simple change allows that to happen. So, now, you could include your pattern with your own theme, and you could also pick and choose from the pattern directory and include those with your theme. Little simple change but I think an important one for people to actually use the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because now, if you wanted to, you could put all your patterns on the pattern directory and then just create a custom theme and then pull them down from the pattern directory into your theme. So, it really opens the doors to a lot of different ways you might want to work with patterns and themes, which I think is exciting. So, glad to see this push through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really glad that made it. But when I thought about, not when I thought about it, I got it from other theme developers who said, okay. So, I was thinking how could we curate the block directory without having a lot of additional changes in Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that change was really good. And now, you can curate, even if you are not a theme developer, but you are working for an agency and your developers have a theme for you and you want to add some of the patterns from the directory you want because of fun or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just add the theme, edit the theme, JSON file and add disabled core patterns, but also edit the same JSON file to pull up. I don&#8217;t know, four or five patterns that you like or from your favorite designer. So, it&#8217;s really cool. But of course having 200 or whatever, how many patterns are in there now? I think it&#8217;s 18?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s one of the things that turns people off in the pattern directory is you open up the&#8230; you&#8217;re just getting everything. And this way, it allows you to really pick and choose what you want to include, which I think is what most people are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, that is already available. If you have updated your WordPress instance to 6.0.2, and there were others, the link in show notes will have the changelog from the make blog, so you can look what are the fixes, where in there, it was a security and maintenance release fix release. So, there are no new features. And this is actually not a new feature it&#8217;s just a-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: A bug. I considered it a bug, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 13.9 and 14.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. So, the last time we had a changelog recording, it was for Gutenberg 13.8. Now, today, we discussed 13.9 and 14. And there were a few enhancements in 13.9. For instance, the media and text blog got a new help for the image settings control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s a little bit clearer what it actually does. The post author block now renders HTML in the editor for the author description that is&#8230; there is this user profile section in the WP admin. And when you write the description for a user that&#8217;s pulled in into a theme, you can actually add HTML to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; I didn&#8217;t read it yet. So, that&#8217;s definitely an enhancement or going back to original feature set. The post feature image now has a link target and attributes. Not quite sure. I&#8217;m fail to see the, oh, you can&#8230; link target is you can open up a new window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, exactly, a new tab. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And I also like that query title in the search template or the search result template. Now, you get some variations there. That is really cool. And then, is the transforms. Transforms is such a powerful tool. But I don&#8217;t think a whole lot of people, developers or plug-in developers or theme viewers are actually using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you can unwrap the group. It&#8217;s actually only a change in or an add-on to the transform menu that you actually can do this&#8230; the box that are assembled into a group can now be separated again. It&#8217;s the same as the more options menu, but it&#8217;s much faster to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And transforms, it&#8217;s actually a huge topic. And later this year, we&#8217;re probably going to talk a lot more about it because there&#8217;s some work in progress. Do you want to take the layout style?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. So, we are breezing by many, many enhancements because we would be here all day if we were talking about each one. But under global styles, you can now add a disabled layout style, theme support flag to opt out of all layout styles, which it just provides developers with more flexibility about how they want styles to be applied. And then, the next one which I&#8217;m really excited about, and I think it&#8217;s so minor. And I&#8217;m excited because this is my ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I saw that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: But it enabled opacity on global styles for color pickers. So, if you&#8217;re in the normal block editor, when you add a color you can actually change the opacity on that color. They&#8217;re nobody&#8217;s no fault of anybody just got left off in global styles, so that got added. So, adding consistency. So, now, you can basically change opacity on colors throughout the all of WordPress, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Good job. Thank you, Nick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, I think that Ellen Bauer pinged me about that and I&#8217;m like, I can fix that one. That one&#8217;s easy. I can do that. And then, for elements, update the load order of CSS in the site editor. We have a lot going on in the editor with different style sheets and different way things are loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with time, we&#8217;re starting to see these&#8230; figuring out the optimal way to load styles and making sure that nothing&#8230; things don&#8217;t interact negatively with one another. So, a nice enhancement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also about the hierarchy, now who comes first. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Exactly. It can get very tricky because we have, what we have the theme, we have core, we have user styles that they edit in global styles. So, there&#8217;s a lot going on in the site editor for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then, we have edited stuff from the theme and it&#8217;s really&#8230; I&#8217;m glad that someone is actually organizing that. So, it&#8217;s not too complicated anymore. The site editor also got up some changes or some enhancements. Well, so, the author nicename template creation is now available for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that concludes with the fallback template for content, all template possibilities that you could create with a site editor, author nicename, it&#8217;s not the username, it&#8217;s a different field in the profile, but you can now do it with that instead of the author name, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, that all the templates are there, we also finally got the view side link in the editor. And I think a lot of millions of people probably are so glad that is actually now available. You don&#8217;t have…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I would hear it so much. I would hear it so much. Where&#8217;s the view site button? And now we have it, which is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we have it. And I think it needs to be more intelligent. So, because when I edit the single page or single post or template, I want to click view site and then see it, but it goes to the homepage. But it&#8217;s one step at a time and I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have to open browsers and do all that, which reminds me so much of previous of WordPress scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. No, it&#8217;s definitely a huge improvement, but more work to be done, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Like Everything in WordPress, you have a first version and then you see what do the people want? What do we do? Let&#8217;s try it first and see what we need. So, I think that&#8230; is that all for 13.9 that we want to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of bug fixes, just a lot of improvements. But I think the meat of new features comes in 14.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think there was a lot as of the 13.9 was really a cleanup things and that continued. There were also in the background, some changes continued from lodash and from the testing that were continued from, and I think the last three or four plugin releases actually. And I&#8217;m right? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at the end of 13.9. In comes Gutenberg 14. And it was just released this week on August 31st. And it came with an enhancement. I would like to change that a little bit up. Let&#8217;s start with the design tools first, because that&#8217;s what everybody&#8217;s waiting for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. This is I&#8217;m so excited about. So, to focus on the example of a paragraph block, one of the things that was missing from the paragraph block was the ability to change the font family and the typography controls. We had all the other stuff but not font family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, you couldn&#8217;t change margin and padding. Now, there&#8217;s good reasons why those, that functionality wasn&#8217;t in Gutenberg yet. There were still some things that needed to be fixed and whether it&#8217;s visualization for margin and padding or interactions with web bonds to do those font family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we finally cut the green light on all this stuff. And there&#8217;s a huge project underway to provide consistency across as many blocks as possible. So, in 14.0, you&#8217;ll now see, for example, font family across not all we&#8217;re not quite done yet, but most blocks. So, it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s that muscle memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you learn how to change font family on one block, and then you go to the next one, you expect that to be there, right? And so, this huge process of standardizing design tools across blocks to me is super exciting. I hear from it all the time from users, why can&#8217;t I do this here? But I can&#8217;t do it here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And huge effort was made in 14.0. And it&#8217;s continuing. And we&#8217;ll be continuing to 14.1. We got tons of typography support, tons of spacing, padding and margin support. And we also got a lot of color supports as well that were missing. So, there&#8217;s a lot there and I encourage you to check out 14.0, because there may have been something you were desperately wanting and it most likely will be in 14.0, if not, 14.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And well, think about how many blocks are there. They&#8217;ll need to be updated. So, that&#8217;s a huge effort for contributors. I&#8217;m not sure, I haven&#8217;t looked at the copays yet, but some blocks do it differently than other blocks in the background. So, it&#8217;s always a&#8230; you can&#8217;t just copy paste like you would do it in a Google doc. You definitely have to think about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: There&#8217;s no magic switch you can just turn on then, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Now, you with theme JSON when every block has it. But up until now, that wasn&#8217;t possible yet. And now, that the controls are there, you also have them in the theme JSON file, so for your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And that&#8217;s a really good point, because I&#8217;m sure there are some people listening when I&#8217;m saying, look at all this new functionality, they might be like, I don&#8217;t want my users to have that. You can always turn this stuff off in theme JSON. So, before you&#8230; even if you wanted it, you couldn&#8217;t have it, now you can have it. But if you don&#8217;t want it can be turned off, so that&#8217;s an important component for those that want to turn off stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s WordPress. If you have new features, we need the code to switch it off. It&#8217;s definitely MO4. It&#8217;s a standard for WordPress, right? All right. So, we mentioned it also before in 13.9, no, with Ryan Welcher&#8217;s Twitch stream, the create-block has a new variant flag as well as a no plugin flag that is in the enhancement section of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted to point out a few other things from the block library. One is a setting to hide the prefix for the archive title. I don&#8217;t know how many people come to me for the classic theme to remove the category string from the archive page or the archive title. And now, with block theme, it wasn&#8217;t possible. So, now, it is. It has come in and it was actually a blocker for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s really funny. This is actually a really interesting issue because the archive title is just it&#8230; the block is just a wrapper around the PHP function that&#8217;s been in WordPress forever. And so, there are people who&#8217;ve been building WordPress forever like, oh, I know how to do that, there&#8217;s just the filter to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then, you have the people that are coming at WordPress in a no code situation and they need the control for that in the block editor. So, it&#8217;s a really interesting like little microcosm of the two worlds coming together and it&#8217;s like you can change it in the filter with PHP, if you know how to do that. Or now, we have the ability to turn off the prefix, which I think is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it enhances WordPress because you&#8230; a user, whenever, you would do this before. Now, they are. So, I&#8217;m really excited about that. Even if you know how to develop, yeah, just making a check mark in an interface is so much easier than, yeah. And open up your development environment, make that change, upload to the server and then, yeah, all…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Google how to do it because you forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then, now, the post-date block on the query block or the post template. Now, you can also select that the date is the last modified date instead of the published date, which is actually also an enhancement that wasn&#8217;t before in WordPress. And so, you always have the latest date of the modification for the post, if all, or page in your Cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, we come to the next big feature, which is the list block has a version two, and it&#8217;s now out of experiments and available in the plugin out of the box. And give it for the next three weeks, a big testing because it will come to retro 6.1, we hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear, but because it&#8217;s coming rather late in there. But it&#8217;s out of experiments. The list items can now be easily better sorted with a much more improved user experience. Did you get a chance to use it yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Oh, yeah. And one of the things that always frustrated me, the original list block, because I kept like, I&#8217;d want to change the order of my list items, and you could. And not that I should have expected that, but you&#8217;re so used to moving blocks around. I&#8217;m like, why can&#8217;t I move this list item? Well, now you can. And it works great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. So, it&#8217;s the little things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It is, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It adds up. And also, in 14.0, we have a few global style changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I can talk about these. So, I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of block gap. And block gap is something that, not everything is making use of, but it&#8217;s the gap between blocks. And those that use it, it&#8217;s an incredibly powerful tool. And one of the things that&#8217;s neat now is the introduction of axial gap support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one of the things that you have is if you imagine columns or buttons that are in a row. Before when you set block gap, it was the gap between the blocks, what happens on mobile when those blocks are displayed vertically. And well, now, you can control both the horizontal gap as well as the vertical gap, which is really powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I hear a lot about or had heard a lot about was the lack of responsive controls within WordPress. And we&#8217;re starting to see how we&#8217;re not getting some interface where you define what you want on mobile and define what you want on tablet. But we&#8217;re getting these more holistic approaches to dealing with different devices and axial gap is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, really great to see. And then, another one, which is, I think honestly, a game changer when it comes to where we&#8217;re going in WordPress is what are called spacing presets. So, if you were changing margin or even block gap or padding, you&#8217;d get a little slider or you could type in a pixel number or you&#8230; it&#8217;s free form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users, that&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s also hard for anybody. Because if you want to have consistent padding or spacing throughout your site and you keep having to enter in a specific number or use a slider, you get, did I add five pixels over here? Did I add 10 over here? I get lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, spacing stuff simplifies that UI where you can define how many steps of padding or margin, how many steps of space so you could have small, medium, large, extra, large, whatever you want. And by enabling this, WordPress provides a set scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in theme at JSON, you can define your own scale. So, I&#8217;ve been playing around with the defining my own scale and it&#8217;s great, and not to go too deep into this, but I&#8217;m very happy. When you define your own scale, you can also define a scale that uses fluid spacing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not only can you define small, medium, large, you can make that spacing value using clamp fluid. So, you can have small on desktop as different from small on mobile. And all of a sudden, you have a very fluid website that&#8217;s adapting based on old devices and it&#8217;s quite amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to take some retooling in how people build themes a little bit that really take advantage of this stuff, but it makes block themes super powerful. And we&#8217;re actually going to start seeing that in the 2023 theme. So, that&#8217;s why back to our original discussion why 2023 is such an important thing, important theme, is this going to provide a real world example of how to use some of this stuff, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that combined with the fluid typography, it has been in the plugin for quite a bit now, but it&#8217;s coming to 6.1. Definitely, it&#8217;s really getting better together for the mobile responsiveness and all that. I had a conversation with plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they had, I think, six view port changes that you can make to the block. And I was thinking, okay, who would actually want that? Who has the patience and the perseverance to change layout for six different view ports? And-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: For every block, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For every block, yeah. So, as you said, the scaling of this is a little bit different. So, on the last item for the global styles we&#8217;re going to talk about is the pseudo element supports for button elements. That is the hub and other pseudo elements for the buttons that you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Focus and active. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Focus and active, yeah. Thank you for helping me out. And we had this already for the link element. And now, we also have it for the button element, and it&#8217;s both in the interface as well as available for theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego:</em> Yeah. Having these additional supports for elements is really great. And it allows you to pull a lot of that CSS that you had in your own style sheet and put it back into the theme JSON. Granted theme JSON, they&#8217;re getting quite big. But the beauty is you can edit it directly in the global style. So, it&#8217;s very powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Awesome. So, good things are coming to WordPress with the next version. I&#8217;m just going through that. And we have some more features, one more feature with&#8230; for the patterns, this new bundle of collections of header and footer block patterns in the plugin, because the directory is not working right with all the dynamic stuff. So, they bundled a few more collections there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s nice to see those updated. The ones that have been there have been in there for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. I think the pattern when, the first introduced like the 5.5 or something like that. So, they&#8217;re coming&#8230; new things are coming in the pattern. There&#8217;s one feature that I really like, it&#8217;s the merging of blocks that you allow, that you can merge wrap blocks or into wrap blocks from both and list group and all that. It&#8217;s a nice quality of life change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it needs a little bit, it takes more to explain that than show that. So, we probably need to do a demo on that and will be demoed on any of the talks that are on workers, learning on workers, not learning WordPress online, meetup groups. I&#8217;m sure some of them will demo that. And that, I think unless we overlooked something, we are at the end of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Well, I mean, for the listeners, we breeze through a lot here. These two releases 5.9 and 14.0 super impactful, but they&#8217;re also give you a really good look about what&#8217;s coming in 6.1. We&#8217;ve had full site editing and block themes in WordPress for a while now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been hesitant to jump in 6.1 is going to have a lot of things that you might have been looking for in order to get started and jump in. So, very excited for 6.1, and having all of this stuff included in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And the next version is 14.1. Of course, the next&#8230; and it will be released on September 14. That&#8217;s interesting because on September 13, it&#8217;s going to be the walkthrough. That&#8217;s a preliminary date. It hasn&#8217;t been officially announced, but it&#8217;s for you listeners here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard it here first. But it&#8217;s when the release leads from a core, technically leads from core and block editor go through what&#8217;s going to be released and demo some of the things. So, we have all the priorities, right? The last version that will make it into WordPress 6.1 of the good note plugin is probably&#8230; so the feature releases on September 20th, there will be a release candidate of WordPress 14.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whatever gets into that release in that milestone will be wrapped up and pushed into WordPress 6.0. And I think the editor release leads will do some last. And of course, the triage will go through that and see what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I have a lot to do with the next few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All of us, because we are going through all the PRs and mark all for dev notes. So, there is a team. And Milana is doing the same for core, for the track tickets to find the dev notes that need to be published, and then we publish them. So, that&#8217;s going to be a really interesting thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I learn so much when I do that. It&#8217;s just mine. I don&#8217;t know where my brain do, it does that. But yeah, I just keep adding to it. So, we are almost at the end of the show. Is there anything, Nick, that you wanted to share with our listeners that you didn&#8217;t get to yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ll do a short plug here. So, our developer relations team at WP Engine, we do a lot of contributing to both the docs team and training and to core. But we also do, produce our own content, take supplement, some of the things that are already out in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, if you just go to wpengine.com/builders, it&#8217;s all just tutorials and articles on building with modern WordPress, very topical to what we&#8217;ve talked about today, talking about fluid typography. One of my favorite articles that I just released is about contextual patterns, which I don&#8217;t think that many people know about or use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a great way of functionality that&#8217;s in Gutenberg and in WordPress to take your theme to the next level. So, yeah, lots of great content. But of course, we&#8217;re always contributing to training docs as well, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I really like what you&#8217;re doing there. All of the articles are really well go deep, sometimes, deep developer wise, sometimes, content creator wise. So, it&#8217;s a great mixture for any target audience pretty much. That&#8217;s terrific. So, thank you for joining me today, sharing your knowledge and opinions with our listeners. And I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting you in-person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I know. Yeah. I can&#8217;t wait. Well, thank you very much for having me.

You made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s what I thought. When Doc Pop invited me to the Pope Magazine.

Dear listeners, our next show will be recorded on September 15th. So, there&#8217;s 13, walkthrough, 14 release, 15th Gutenberg changelog recording. It will be released shortly after. And we will have the brilliant Channing Ritter from the WordPress design team on the show. As always the show notes will be published on gutenburgtimes.com/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is episode 72.

This is a fun little feature that was tucked into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">Gutenberg 13.9</a> changelog last month with very little fanfare:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Rich text: Add character shortcuts for wrapping selection. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42469\">42469</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The new shortcut is a rich text feature contributed by Automattic-sponsored WordPress core committer Ella van Durpe. It works in a similar way that <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31571\">pasting a link over selection</a> will auto-link the text instead of replace it, a feature that landed seven years ago which she also worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new quotes shortcut escaped my notice until I saw George Mamadashvili&#8217;s quick video demo on Twitter: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My new favorite Block Editor shortcut is the ability to wrap selected text in quotes. Select text and press `, \' or \". <br /><br />This nifty little feature shipped with Gutenberg 13.9. However, the editor always supported air quotes. <a href=\"https://t.co/VnPqv6E44U\">pic.twitter.com/VnPqv6E44U</a></p>&mdash; George Mamadashvili (@Mamaduka) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mamaduka/status/1565761697989726209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 2, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a clever feature that is commonly supported by IDE&#8217;s like IntelliJ and PyCharm. Although wrapping with quotes is likely the most common use case for this type of shortcut, it also supports wrapping the selection with a back tick (<code>`</code>), which will automatically wrap it in a code tag instead of replacing the selection with a back tick. van Durpe demonstrated this in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42469\">PR</a> with a gif:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you frequently copy and paste text that is meant to be in quotes, or code that needs backticks, this new shortcut is a major timesaver and one of the most exciting features to land in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\">13.9</a>. van Durpe said it was generalized to work with any characters, such as pressing <code>(</code> to wrap the selection in parenthesis, instead of deleting the selection. However, this was scaled back a bit during the review before the PR was merged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit worried with expanding these to characters that are natural openers because I suspect it&#8217;s a typical action to select a word and type the first letter of what should replace it — parentheses and quotation marks, in particular, would have a much higher incidence of cases where the intention is indeed to replace the selected text with the mark, not to wrap it in them,&#8221; Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura concluded that it&#8217;s worth testing but suggested more characters be added incrementally to focus feature announcements on the ones they are more certain about &#8220;without the ones that could be problematic tainting the feature.&#8221; This is possibly the reason it wasn&#8217;t highlighted in the release post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backtick and quote characters are the only two included in this iteration of the feature. It&#8217;s not easy for users to discover in the natural course of using the editor, so it might need a little promotion for people to start using it enough to know if it&#8217;s going to become one of those indispensable features or something that is inadvertently causing frustration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Sep 2022 03:29:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:01:11 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:45:32 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}', 'no');
